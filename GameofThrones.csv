[SPOILERS] What was Roose plan having R marry S?,7,pnbuok,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/pnbuok/spoilers_what_was_roose_plan_having_r_marry_s/,19,1631524325.0," I am on  a rewatch and this is something I never really reflected upon before,  what exactly is his plan? It makes zero sense to me that he would bet on  the Lannisters going out of power anytime soon at that point, so is his  plan to sieze the North for himself and then launch a campaign towards  the crown? If that's the case why would Sansa back them after what they  have done and what Ramsay is, he would have to break her like Theon  pretty much but even then he would need every single lord on board to  even have a slight chance against the Lannisters.

I  can't really find a way that it makes much sense considering how, let's  say, pragmatic Roose Bolton has been made out to be earlier on. He even  flat out says that he doesn't trust Littlefinger but even if he did it  would be a declariation of war on the crown pretty much unless he hoped  to keep Sansa locked up in secret but then why have an official wedding  at that point and not just ""save her"", locked away, for later?",2021-09-13 14:42:05

She had been born into a family of madness, but she had managed to rise above her nature and become an icon of freedom and change.

 Instead of having Dany destroy the town when she heard the bells, wouldn't it have been great if she had had that moment of fury, hesitation, seething vengefulness...and fought against it? There could have even been the same lead-up with all of the other characters mentioning the meaning of the bells, so the viewer expects (and dreads) that Dany will hear them and ignore them. Then, when the time comes, there's that moment where you can tell she's considering doing the worst that she can to the city, and you're seriously not sure which option she'll choose. Then she backs down. The city is spared. 

I think it could have lead up to a great realization on her behalf; that she has the power and drive to become queen, but she also has a rage within her that must be tempered. Perhaps she could have ruled alongside someone who would have helped to calm the violent tendencies that came to her head. It would have been an excellent recognition of strength and weakness, and how we must depend on one another to bring out our best side while helping us handle ourselves at our worst.

Anyway, rant over. I just had the idea and thought I'd post it here. What do you guys think?",2021-09-13 01:24:14

I  hate how it has become conventional wisdom that the ending of Game of  Thrones was terrible. I saw another article (about Wheel of Time) that  made sure to mention Game of Thrones and it's ""bad ending"".

I  thought it was (other than being rushed and needing about another five  episodes) excellent, with all the plot points tied up in a way that made  narrative sense and didn't feel like some sort of young-adult,  chosen-one cliche.

Jaime's ending  was not stupid and pointless -- it was poignant and spoke of the  complexity of his character. His and Cersei's love was tragic, and  flawed, but it was who they were. I had no interest in seeing Jaime  shack up with Brienne.

Bran was  always going to be the king -- This was always the story of The Starks,  from the moment they were the first characters (and Bran the first  character) we meet after the prologue in book 1. While The Night King,  Cersei, Daenerys, Stannis, Renly, Robert, et al are all just different  flavours of the same cycle of conquest and power and might makes right,  Bran's journey from child, to invalid, to three-eyed-raven, coupled with  Hodor's backstory would have made zero narrative sense otherwise.   ""What's the story about? Loads of people are warring for the throne and  all think they deserve it -- oh, and there's a crippled kid who talks to  birds and trees and wanders around a bit in the tundra"".

I'm  not going to repeat the ""Daenerys wouldn't do that!"" debunking that's  been countered a thousand times. If people haven't accepted that by now  then I don't know what to say. I'll just say that she was an antagonist  for me the second she burned an innocent woman (a lone survivor after  her husband massacred her whole village) alive and then morphed into a  female version of her terrible brother with better PR.

The  Night King died at the right time for me, too. I'm glad that he was  almost a red herring. It reminded me of The Lord of the Rings when life  went on (interesting how that was cut in the films -- probably Peter  Jackson predicted a similar reaction to that we got after The Long  Night) after the fall of Sauron, and thugs and thieves and a greatly  diminished Saruman (who was, by that point, just a bandit) had to be  dealt with. The existential threat is gone, but people still suck. Texts  are, after all, always about HUMANITY first and foremost. Not  everything is about blowing up the Death Star and having an Ewok Village  celebration and fade to black.",2021-09-12 15:47:10

I binged the show in less than a month, which was super fun. Yeah the destination wasn’t very good, but I LOVED the journey. From a filmmaking standpoint, it’s an incredible show, with some of the best production value I’ve seen on TV. And the writing is amazing in seasons 1-6. I love how the show was always one step ahead of me. My favorite scene in the show might be scene where The Mountain duels Oberyn Martell, because it’s an example of how great the writing is condensed into one scene. Any other show or movie would have Oberyn get his revenge on the people who raped his sister, then killed her along with her children. But nope, this is Game of Thrones. The way the show throws all the narrative cliches out the window and brilliantly subverts the viewers expectations made me fall in love with the show. It’s shock value, but not just for the sake of shock value. Almost everything had a reason and justification for happening. Obviously, season 8 lacks this, which is why I don’t like it, but it doesn’t take away everything great the show has done in my opinion. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t disappointed with the ending, I really am. It wasn’t a matter of choices the characters made, but how those choices were developed. Every choice made in the end could’ve been pulled off, even Dany’s heel turn, but it was just so damn rushed. But the first 6 seasons are a 10/10 (or at least close to it) in my eyes, and even season 7 wasn’t awful. They just didn’t stick the landing, and I don’t believe that ruins everything great the show did.",2021-09-12 07:40:56

How does this go down in this scene and how does it affect the series.

I think Selmy could have turned the tide of the battle.  If so, Cersei is arrested and Stannis becomes king.  Stannis rewards Ned and he goes back to Winterfell with both his children.  Stannis may even betroth his daughter Shireen to Rickon Stark.  Stannis keeps Cersei and her children as hostages to keep Tywin in line.  I wonder how Tywin would react.  I suspect he would revolt, but perhaps using subterfuge.

Sansa eventually marries some other lord, one picked by Ned and Cat and thus a good and kind man.  Rob never meets his wife, but will marry someone else, likely also arranged.  Arya continues to train at Winterfell.  She never becomes an assassin, but she does become a good swordsman and likely grows up to become an explorer.  Bran eventually makes it north of the wall, but it does take longer.  When he goes, he goes with a small army to protect him.

Ned tells Jon about his mother.  Jon, having taken the black, cannot take the Iron Throne, but he does not care for such things anyway.  He might even start going by the name given to him by his mother.  Either way, his story changes little.  However, Jon does tell Ned about the White Walkers and Ned would believe him and Lord Commander Mormont.  As a result, Ned organizes the north and tells Stannis.

Stannis believes Ned especially since Melisandre will confirm this.  Stannis organizes the rest of Westeros to fight the biggest war in history.  Since Stannis is proactive, the White Walker may even be defeated before Daenerys arrives in Westeros.  When Daenerys finally does arrive, Stannis kills her with a shadow baby as he has not used one before.  He will have to contend with the dragons, Dothraki, and Unsulled, but perhaps the dragons having lost their mother would obey no one and would just go feral.  Eventually Stannis takes down the dragons with scorpions or soldiers.  Dragons without leaders are still dangerous, but they aren't going to win any wars.

Is this depiction of Mace in the TV show accurate?

Game of Thrones is one of my favorite series, but season 8 as a whole was.. not good. So completely rushed and so many nonsensical moments. As a very big fan, it was really sad to witness. The worst thing about the final season however, is not that it was bad in itself, but that it retroactively makes the WHOLE show worse. Before season 8 came out, I was planning on rewatching the entire series from start to finish this summer vacation, but now I just.. don't have the desire to do so anymore. Season 8 makes so, so many plotlines entirely useless.

* The White walkers. This plotline is definitely the one that suffered the most. Introduced in the prologue to the entire show, and always hyped up to be THE supernatural main threat, they were just laughably easy defeated. How can you still be invested in this plotline, when you know the white walkers will all die without bringing about the mythical 'Long Night', without even properly getting into Westeros?
* Jon's Targaryen heritage.. I'm not saying he should have ended up as the King in the end, but him being a Targaryen should have had SOME impact, aside from turning Daenerys mad. How can you still get goosebumps during the 'cut from Baby Jon to grown up Jon' in the 'Winds of Winter', knowing his Targaryen heritage and general arc will lead to nothing? Or his epic stare-down with the Night King in Hardome, which also lead to absolutely nothing..
* The endings for Jaime, Daenerys, Bran, etc.. will also lessen the impact of their storylines. Is Jaime's redemption storyline going to be as good during a rewatch, knowing he will just end up with Cersei in the end and die with her? Is watching Daenerys trying to be a good ruler in Mereen for 3 seasons going to be interesting again, knowing she will die as a cartoon villain after destroying King's Landing? And what even is the point of Bran's storyline, if you know he will end up doing literally nothing (and being proclaimed King doesn't really count, because that has never even once been foreshadowed).

There are many more examples, but these are to my mind the biggest ones. And I'm really not bashing on the show, I love this series so much. But I can't shake the feeling that season 8 retroactively ruined a lot of the show.. I will certainly rewatch it again sometime in the future, but I fear it will never be the same again, and not in a good way..",2021-09-08 02:36:12

In 5:2, he is present at the Night's Watch when the election for the 998th Lord Commander takes place.

Ser Alliser Thorne was supposed to win in a landslide. When an unknown character nominates this gentlemen from the Shadow Tower who just magically showed up. Mallister, an old veteran of the Night's Watch seemed to appeal to the conservative members of the Night's Watch who may have been put off by Ser Alliser's harsh treatment of new recruits, yet would have never voted for Jon Snow. After all, ""He helped keep the wildlings away"".

Perhaps Alliser thought he would dominate a one-on-one election with Mallister, which would have probably been correct just on name recognition. When Jon Snow is nominated by Samwell Tarly, that changes everything, as many see Jon's short but proven time with the Night's Watch in a very high light. Now instead of running unopposed, Alliser has a real fight on his hands.

When we look at Maester Aemon counting the votes, it should be noted in the show only a simple majority is needed to win. We see Jon Snow with 28 votes, Ser Alliser with 28 votes, and that plucky man from the Shadow Tower with 8 votes.

Denys Mallister's involvement as a sort of third party candidate pulled votes away from Ser Alliser. It contributed to the tie, and led to Maester Aemon casting the tiebreaking vote for Jon Snow. If Mallister had not run, Ser Alliser would have won comfortably with those 8 Mallister votes going his way.

With Ser Alliser in charge, the entire show is changed. Jon Snow could end up going with Stannis and becoming Jon Stark. The wildlings aren't led south as Ser Alliser would have never allowed it. Daenarys never flies north (maybe never even meeting Jon). The Night King wouldn't have had Viserion.

Think of Ser Denys Mallister as the Gary Johnson of Game of Thrones. He changed the entirety of the show.

Also, it's just ""a theory"" so no need to get offended...   
So I've been wondering if the Night king was actually the Victim in this show. Now I haven't read all the  other sidebooks of ASOIAF, but I did read a lot of wiki articles... so I may be short a few facts.. but just listen me out.   
So What if the NK, wasn't all bad. I mean.. think of it this way... He was forced to become a monster, using the magic of the Children. The children are never really explained to us, nor their ways. He was supposed to help the Children fight the First men, But instead, went rogue, causing the children and The First Men unite against the bigger enemy. Now, maybe the NK is all conscious. He must have lost all his family, and closed ones, and he thought, with the power to bring them all back, it would have been better for him and them. Though the walkers don't speak, they do have a way to communicate with each other. He wanted revenge upon those who made him that way.   
About the 3-eyed Raven, we don't know much, Just that the one Bran met was a bastard targaryen and they had the ability to warg into other animals, and see the things that were, things that are, and things that have not yet come to pass... And that Bran changed totally on becoming the raven. What if it isn't a power or a knowledge, but the leader of the children(the children did serve the 3 eyed raven and gave their lives to protect him) who found out a way to be immortal, by possessing the body of another person, though to keep his foresight, the person should have been a warg, who let him in of his own will(though not consciously). So he kept an eye on the best of wargs, (Bran was the only one who could warg into another Human(Hodor). When Meera said to Bran that he died in the cave, she meant it. Maybe Bran's soul is dead and his body is possessed by the Raven's spirit or maybe Bran's soul in trapped somewhere in hsi own body, while the Raven is dominating over it. There was a lot of ways for the final season to occur, but Bran did just the thing he wanted in just the way he wanted, to make himself King.   
Bran was already home at winterfell before Jon's expedition north to capture the Wight. He could easily have warned Dany and Jon to beware and control her dragons since the NK's gonna kill it. He could have just as well warned about Rhaegal being killed by Euron's ships but he didn't. I mean, even if he couldn't see the future(which he can since he said ""Why do you think I came all this way?"" as he knew that he was gonna be made king so he couldn't be lord of anything) he would have atleast known that the scorpions were made and loaded on the ships.... but he didn't do anything to warn them. He let Missandei die and Dany go mad. Also before, HE could have informed Jon of his parentage just when he reached Winterfell. But he chose not to. He told Sam ""it's time"" cuz he knew informing Dany when he did, would put a major strain in their relation. Hence Jon killing Dany in the end and Bran crowned King. Now he says he cannot sire children, which wasn't confirmed by even a single Maester. All that was confirmed was that he cannot walk. I do understand that being crippled that way might make one lose the ability to procreate but no one said he couldn't. Of course when he was treated by the maesters, he was too young to be checked properly, he could have been checked later. But over the years of planning, the only way which the Ravens though possible for himself to be crowned king was this way, and also having the support of all houses. He will most probably pick up another warg and transform him to become another host for the Raven's spirit ""cuz who has a better story than the Raven"".
NK wanted to kill the Raven because he knew of this plan of his. He predicted how many people would die because of it, and he wanted to stop it. Over time, he realized that men are mortal and that if he transformed them they would live forever. So with a heavy heart and a positive mission, he attacked all the Men, with the hope that he'd raise them again and they wont be dead. But he would kill the Raven himself, with his sword/spear to his heart, just like he was tortured with a shard of dragonglass to the heart. Yes his means were wrong but his intent was totally understandable and acceptable. 
I might have a few more things to say but I cannot recall it just yet... Might continue in comments down below.. please comment your views to support or contradict the theory",2021-09-07 00:19:54

1. Since they're both mediocre at best how do they rise in a position to head GOT for HBO?
2. And secondly, why on Earth would they get exrtemely expensive deals/offers from Disney to make a Star Wars trilogy (which is not happening anymore) and an offer from Netflix, of which the only thing they've produced so far was 1 comedy special and I believe they're adapting another book series for Netflix now.

Obviously the Red Wedding was the climax to this  heartbreaking story, but even the build up in the episodes previous, Rob’s army unraveling, strategies failing, pressure building against him.

Understandable, given that Littlefinger is accused of murdering Lysa Arryn.

But he doesn't seem to have any reaction toward Sansa for her own part in Lysa Arryn's death and Littlefinger's rise to power in the Vale. Sansa had previously given direct testimony to him that Lysa had stepped through the moon door on her own, testimony which protected Littlefinger and ensured he was free to pull the strings in the Vale. Then at the trial Sansa changes the story to accuse Baelish of pushing her through.

Seeing Sansa governing smartly as lady of Winterfell, and learning that the testimony he saw was Sansa lying convincingly, I'd have thought he'd have started to doubt whether her testimony could so easily be explained away as being given under duress, and been a little more suspicious that she was a clever manipulator who'd been conspiring with Littlefinger, not an vulnerable child. 

I think if it were me in Royce's boots, I'd be a bit more wary about Sansa's actions after that, and certainly wouldn't be quite so keen for Robyn to accept her brother as King over the Vale while she takes the North independent.",2021-09-04 14:18:34

I liked the first two episodes. I feel they really bring back a lot of what made me fall in love with the show in the first place.  Even the battle, for the most part, was great. I would have removed some of the plot armor from some of the characters though. Especially with the blunder in the crypts of Winterfell. My biggest change to that episode, that changes the whole rest of the show, is that they lose that battle. 

Bran: He could have been so important and intriguing. The show already has shown that Bran can manipulate the past. In one of the Three Eyed Raven scenes in season 6 or 7, Bran sees the true events of the Tower of Joy.  For a moment, Bran calls out to his young father. Young Ned hears Bran and reacts, proving Bran can influence the past.  I wanted the show to dive deeper into this. It almost seems like they were going to go down this path, but something changed by the end of season 7.  Bran constantly got visions of the Mad King in the throne room, cursing ""burn them all.""  What if Bran went back to the past and corrupted the Mad King. Whispering of the cold death that marches in the north. Trying to get the Mad King to deal with the white walkers,  that way, they're already dead in the future.  But the whispers just drive him mad, the true reason for his madness. Bran failed. Now the king is insane and there's nothing he can do to stop him burn his grandfather and uncle alive. Burn them all. Bran meant the white walkers.  He meant the dead. The Mad King took that to mean everyone.  Determined, he goes deeper into the past to find some other way to stop it.  He goes back further and further, each time failing, each time making the past happen as it has.  Until he's as back as far as he can go. He's at the creation of the white walkers by that tree with the Children of the forest. They sense him. Use some old magic to force Bran into the man they have tied to the tree. The children turn then turn the man into the Night King.  It's mission set by the Children of the forest to beat back mankind.  So thats what he does for thousands of years. Until eventually,  the Night King comes across Bran for the first time. They touch. Something awakens in the Night King. It's what's left of Bran. It's calling out for one last attempt to end this. To end it all before it begins. All he needs to do is kill Bran before he travels back to be turned into the Night King. That becomes his new motivation. Now, I should mention that all this time travel influencing stuff is happen from the time Bran gets to Winterfell. You know, when he's pretty much useless sitting there in the Godswood? Well, this gives him something to do. Until the battle. His last ditch effort is on that night. Thats the night he goes back as far as he can to see the Night King get created. That's the night he becomes the Night King. Remember when Bran caused Hodor to Hodor and that daisy chained the rest of Bran's life to happen? We learned there that Bran can't change the past, he can only complete his roll to allow the past to happen.  So that's what he did here.  Once Bran travels back to the past for the final time, the Night King will have just entered the Godswood. 

The Long Night:  Like I said earlier,  some of this plot armor has to go.  In the Godswood, as the Night King is approaching Bran, an epic battle ensues with Theon, Arya, Beric, and Gendry against the white walkers. One by one, they're getting mowed down. First Beric, then Gendry. They take out 2 white walkers before they die, but its not enough. It's Arya and Theon backed up against Bran. Theon tells Arya to run before being cut down. She makes her way to the tree line and looks back in time to see the Night King plunge his sword into the warged Bran.  She escapes the Godswood and sneaks around the overrun castle, looking for survivors.  She finds the Hound, Brianne and Tormond, fighting in the courtyard. She tells them we've lost, we need to run. They fight there way to the crypt. Arya knows a secret way out of the castle through there. That's where they find Sansa, Tyrion and Davos. Gilly and Messandei died in the crypt. The rest make their way out of the city and into the dark winter woods. Dany and Drogon helped Jon escape the Wight Dragon and flew away. That's all that gets away. Everyone else dies.  The Night King wins. Now, with that last bit of Bran Stark resolved, the Night King continues its original intended goal, beat back humanity. That night, the army of the dead begins its march south.  

Cercei: In my version, she would get what she deserves.  Winter would come for Kings Landing.  But the Night King as a different tactic. He surrounds the city with a mile of undead and waits.  He waits and waits and waits.  After all, he brings the storm. And a city of a million people can only last so long without provisions. People start dying by the thousands.  Until the only ones left are the rich and their guard. At least what's left after the uprisings. Months go by, and Cercei is about ready to have her child. Her water breaks. There's only one wet nurse  left to help her from the throne room to the nursery.  On her way down, her foot slips on an icy step. The nurse runs for a maester. At the bottom of the staircase, bleeding, Cercei lies screaming, for Jaimie, for her baby.  The maester and the wet nurse manage to get Cercei to the nursery, she's still screaming in pain, bleeding profusely. She looks down at her wriggling stomach in horror. She can only scream and claw at the ground as she watches her belly torn open from the inside. And what emerges, ironically looks like what Cercei imagined Tyrion looked like when he killed their mother. Except this creature was partially rotted, and glowing a blue eye.  That's how I would have liked Cercei to meet her end. 

So TLDR:
Bran made the Mad King mad.
Bran's the Night King on accident. 
Night King wins at Winterfell and kills almost everyone except like 10 people. 
Cercei gets eaten by her undead unborn monster baby.

The score is Westeros:0, Night King:2 

Thats all I'm going to write for now. Theres more involving the end of winter, Cleganebowl and Jon and Dany's baby. Let me know if you guys wanna hear how this version ends in a part 2.",2021-09-04 11:41:32

(Also disclaimer, I too didn’t like Sansa at all at first but she grew on me and now she’s a favourite of mine.) So much of the hate she gets is baseless, especially this:

A lot of people say they dislike her because she ‘betrayed’ her family, when she had to write a letter  to Robb asking to surrender, even though it was obviously not her words to Robb and Maester Luwin. It even comes up in season seven when the show writers tried to make us think Arya and Sansa would kill each other. 
I never understood why this was such a big issue.  Basically I feel like this reason for hating her is kinda baseless and unfair. Like, a 13 year old was held captive and forced to write a letter to her brother about surrendering, so apparently she’s a traitor? Why hold her up to such high standards, she’s a powerless kid. What was she meant to do, punch her way out of kings landing?

I recently finished writing my own six episode Season 8. It was purely for fun and to spend time in the world of GoT; I'm a huge fan (my left arm is covered in tattoos of house sigils) but like a lot of people I was really disappointed (to put it mildly!) with the final season we got. I like to think my scripts put right a lot of the major issues, but also take things in interesting and surprising directions. Very few of the characters end up where they did in the show proper.

I'm currently working on the idea of recording the scripts as a radio play and putting them online as a podcast. 

Long story, short, I'd love to hear from anybody that might have an interest in providing one or potentially multiple character voices. If so, please do let me know you age/sex/accent etc and if there's anyone in particular you think you'd be a good fit for. *Just to be totally clear, this is just a bit of fun (hopefully) between fans, so there's no remuneration or professional credits involved.* If there is interest, I can move forward with the logistics of recording/editing etc, and if there's not, well, I'll be happy to just go back to writing my Robert's Rebellion prequel series (Season 1 available on Reddit, if anyone's interested or wants to get a sense of my writing before expressing interest in the radio play of Season 8).

&#x200B;

If Daenerys didn't go mad, she would either win the throne or somehow lose to Cersei, but in either case nothing would change and there would be no point to the show. The entire show would basically be a glimpse of a random timeline in Westeros, in which this king ruled and then that king tried to take the throne, but the ""game of thrones"" would never stop.

&#x200B;

Instead, from the beginning of the show we got to see enough reference history to understand what was Westeros like, and in the ending we witnessed the biggest and most dramatic event in the history of Westeros - the end of the game of thrones.

&#x200B;

And in order to ""break the wheel"" (ironic, ik) Daenerys had to prove herself not any better than those who ruled before her, and the show portrayed it beautifully. 

&#x200B;

The beginning of her end was when she begged John Snow not to reveal his true identity. Up until that point you would never think that Daenerys Targaryen, the Mother of Dragons, the Breaker of Chains, the badass girl that led thousands of followers after her across the sea was one to beg. But she understands full well what would the consequences be, and after getting so close to winning her throne, the thought of suddenly losing it stresses her out so much that she can't think straight. Why not marry John instead?

&#x200B;

Then there's the feast after the living won the dead. Daenerys watches as Tormund hails for John and says something like, ""What kind of a man rides a dragon? A mad man, or a King!"". At some point Daenerys walks up and leaves and later that day she tells John that she recognizes the way people look at him, that it's the same way people used to look at her back in Essos, but never here in Westeros. Why not rule Essos then? But she is infatuated with this idea that she belongs with the Iron Throne.

&#x200B;

And then there's probably the most impactful scene in the entire show, when John Snow comes to visit Tyrion in his cell right before killing Daenerys. Tyrion tells him that Daenerys' infatuation with the throne blinds her to reality, and that she is going to keep ""liberating"" city after city until she rules them all.

&#x200B;

And the lesson I found in all that, after watching everything again with neutral eyes, is that you can't take what isn't yours. Every single character who had this vision that they are something grand and miraculous  - found themselves in over the head and eventually lost.

&#x200B;

Probably the most important characters are Tyrion and Varis. Both are humble and realistic, never blinded to the truth because of some vision or prophecy. Both are servants to what they believe in, and yet both rose to power and helped shape the history from behind the scenes.

&#x200B;

Varis dying was, heartbreaking as it was, inevitable. He tried his best to serve the realm, humbly, never once thinking that he deserves more, and remaining true to himself despite the consequences. 

Daenerys asked him that if ever comes a time when he thinks she is failing her people as a queen, he would tell her about it instead of betraying her. But Varys knew full well that she is beyond all reason - her vision of sitting on the throne is so strong in her mind that nothing will stop her from achieving it. Upon dying, his last words are that he hopes he is wrong, meaning he is still true to his cause, even on the verge of death.

&#x200B;

Everything written above is nothing more than an opinion, and I'm happy to discuss other opinions.",2021-09-03 03:01:07

**Title:** Season 6, Chapter 6: RAYMAR

**Author:** David Melies (FF) (Medium) (WattPad) (AO3)

**Language:** English

**Rating:** Mature

**Length:** 6 Chapters. 32,420 words. Ongoing.

**Summary:**  
I’m particularly proud of this one…. This chapter is the most personal I've written yet.  
Raymar is a brand new protagonist, that I wrote from scratch, (he doesn't exist in the show/books) within a new storyline, filled with other original characters, that I believe not only blends seamlessly with the show's storyline, but actually makes it more significant.

But you'll be the judge of that :) I'm excited to read what you think!

So in this episode as I understand, Meera has just after a very long journey successfully delivered Brann back to safety and is now entering his room to say goodbye as she wants to leave to return to be with her family when / if the white walkers come. 

So Meera says goodbye and brann basically just says like “thank you” or a very simple and monotone response. (He’s clearly a bit different from the version of him she had previously met.)

She takes offense to this and is emotional and says her brother died and she almost died and that’s all he has to say?

He then says something like “I’m not really brann anymore I’m the 3 eyed raven.” 

Then she says you died in that cave!!!! And cries and exits abruptly. 

So I paused here and I said her response was kinda unnecessarily emotional because 

1. From day one the known collective goal was to deliver brann to the other 3 eyed raven guy / it was known that brann was a special character who was to be protected 

2. He said thank you??? Yeah he was monotone but he thanked you. What else are you expecting? Did you and your brother do what you did for praise and thanks and interpersonal relations or was it for reason number 1 that I wrote above?

3. He is clearly becoming less like brann and more the 3 eyed raven (which was always the goal refer to number 1,) and he even admits to this yet she still just walks out emotionally. 

My boyfriend on the other hand thinks she is deserving of more of a response than thank you. He also is of the mindset that she was only along on the initial quest because her brother was and that she was not necessarily aware of the main objective nor was she aware of Brann’s importance as the three eyed raven. 


Now my boyfriend is going to take my phone and write out his argument for himself. 

1. From day one Meera was trying to talk her brother out of helping him
2. During the journey people she loved died
3. When saying goodbye she got a thank you…
I believe she grew emotional attachment to her journey and Brandon stark. So she left feeling hurt that it seemingly meant nothing to him.

OKAY now it’s me again and not my boyfriend. 

I can acknowledge the inevitable humanlike emotions that she felt but my whole point is that the purpose was larger than that and she knew it from day one. 

Okay now my boyfriend wants to get in one last word since I got in one last word… 

She can acknowledge the fact she acted with emotion…. Hmmm that’s what I’m saying

Ok now it’s me again not my boyfriend. 
Anyways. What do YOU ALL think?",2021-08-31 11:10:36

2. They look easy to forge, can't anyone just create a duplicate seal, forge a letter, and claim it's the official word of a house?

But I do know that, when it comes to shows that have a lot of fans and if many are displeased. They can get together and form a collective ""Group Think"" where many are influenced by the opinions of the majority rather than actually taking the time to sit with it and judge for themselves whether they like it or not.  I experienced this with the ending of LOST. A show, like GOT that was heavily reviled by a large portion of it's fans for it's final few seasons, and especially it's ending  (though the reasoning is somewhat different. Many misunderstood it and viewed the whole series as a collective dream or purgatory, which wasn't true, it did explore purgatory but only with one storyline).  I was one of the fans that loved the ending and the journey leading to it. In recent years, the show is being looked at with fresh eyes and reevaluated. Now there is a lot of reaction videos with many adoring the majority of the show (one reactor called season 6 his favorite season).

My questions are. Do you see the same happening with GOT?:

* If you loved the ending (final few seasons). What did you like about it?.
* Do you think the final few seasons get unfairly criticized, if so, why?.
* Is there a character in particular that you loved their arc? (which get's criticized).

Loras is part of the Kingsguard, he has an actual personality beyond his sexuality, whereas in the show its like ""oh look, he's gay!"", and then... yeah. Nothing, really. They take everything from Loras that makes him a good character in the books.

Even more angry am I about the fact that they took away the friendship between Jaime and Loras. Jaime defended him against Cersei (more than once), and wanted to make him the Lord Commander while he's gone; he even compared Loras to himself (and to Cersei, once, I think).

And all of that is gone in the show, his love for Renly is downplayed to a degree where he screws some other man as soon as he gets to it while in the books he still mourns Renly (and tells Jaime about it, actually).

Loras, in the books, is one of my favorite characters. And then in the show he's just... there? And then he gets captured, and then he's dead. It's so.. disappointing and I wonder why they did it?",2021-08-29 22:52:42

Top 5 most interesting 

1. Jaime Lannister - Jaime is more complex as the books go one. He is conflicted by duty and love for his family, and duty to the people as a knight. Jaime leads us to question what is “right” and ask ourselves what would we do on his shoes. His fall from grace and efforts to be an honorable man make his character arc one of the best  in the series.

2. Theon Greyjoy. Theon is another who challenges the ideas of loyalty. He has the most gruesome and redeeming character arcs in the series. 

3. Stannis Baratheon: stannis makes the audience ask themselves what makes a good leader? Is it roberts strength, reply’s flair and charisma or an undying sense of duty. Stannis is tortured by his past and is a character we all can relate to.

Tyrion: this one is pretty obvious. The witty quips keep the audience entertained while turning the typical hero trope on its head.

Sandor Clegane: the hound makes us ask ourselves what is truly good? He id a tortured character who despises the knightly ideals we grew up with. Best antihero in the series.

Top 5 most uninteresting:

1. Robb stark: while a fan favorite Robb was too much the knight in shining armor trope with little interesting dialogue.

2. Bran stark: not his fault but it’s from the perspective of an 8 year old. Not terribly interesting.

3. Cersei Lannister: her whiny and bratty nature at times make her chapter unreadable. I found her to be a bit one noted.

4. Viserys Targaryen: this is another who is one noted. We get it you want your crown…

5. Victarion Greyjoy: while conceptually cool he pales in comparison to his brother euron. He is an ill tempered and dumb brute who’s chapters I did not care for.",2021-08-29 00:18:05

I've been trying to get my brother into this series for years. He adores LotR (his favorite books of all time, likely), and fantasy in general, but he's never been much of a TV-lover, and I think the length of the series is really daunting to him (that, and he has heard how poorly the series ended, and doesn't want to sink too much time into it because of it). For some context, I'm also trying to get him to read the books, but I'd prefer to be able to *watch* along with him so we could enjoy it together.

As disappointed as I was with the ending myself, I still love the show, and in particular, think the early seasons are some of the best fantasy television around-- I can't imagine him not enjoying it, if he gave it a fair shot.

**After some teeth-pulling, I have the opportunity to show him a single episode to try to get him hooked.** Which episode do you think best encapsulates the magic of those early seasons, while being accessible to someone coming in cold, and not *too* spoilery?

I'm actually currently doing a rewatch, and after just finishing it, I am heavily considering S4E9 (""The Watchers on the Wall""). You've got a pretty cool fight sequence, some story/character-building before the fight, and I think it would be relatively easy to see what roles the characters fill, even coming in cold. There's the death of Ygritte, which is a spoiler, to be sure, but it's not on par with, say, the Red Wedding, etc. It's potentially flawed in that the entire episode takes place in one setting, which doesn't give you a taste of the huge scope of the world, though (something I can imagine a Tolkien-lover enjoying).

Anyway, I'm interested to hear what anyone who has read the books or seen (and still has some admiration for) the TV show thinks about how I could best get him hooked.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!",2021-08-27 19:28:20

[spoilers] How would Danerys have conquered Westeros if Tyrion didn't turn stupid in season 7?,7,pci6kk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/pci6kk/spoilers_how_would_danerys_have_conquered/,24,1630047436.0,"I'm in my yearly re-watch and I'm at the point where I'm drudging my way through season 7, and I got back to thinking - how would Danerys' conquest have gone if Tyrion hadn't started taking stupid pills? Here's my thought -   
Step 1: Upon striking the alliance with Dorne and the Tyrells, immediately march the Dornish army to Highgarden to combine their strength. Tyrion should know that the Lannister army would outmatch the Tyrells on their own if Cersei went on the offensive.  
Step 2: Deploy the Dothraki, commanded by Tyrion, to liberate the Riverlands and strike an alliance with Edmure Tully and the Riverlords. Then have the Dothraki capture and occupy Harrenhall so they're positioned on the mainland if they're needed again.  
Step 3: Sail the Greyjoy and Unsullied fleets together to the western sea, guarded by Danerys and 2 dragons (1 dragon remains with Missandei to guard Dragonstone), to find and kill Euron Greyjoy and capture or destroy his fleet. Tyrion should so, so, so obviously have known that Euron was their biggest military threat.  
Step 4: Once Euron is defeated, send the Unsullied to take Casterly Rock. Theon then takes the Unsullied ships to retake the Iron Islands. Danerys and Yara recover the Tyrell treasury and supplies from Highgarden and take them back to Dragonstone for safe keeping.  
Step 5: Embark Varys on a secret mission to the Stormlands to find out what the hell has been going on there since Stannis sailed north and if there are any allies to be found. If not, march the Tyrell and Dornish armies to Storm's End to take the castle and stage them for the siege of King's Landing.  
Step 6: Surround King's Landing with the Dornish and Tyrells from the south and east, the Tullys from the north, and the Greyjoy fleet from the sea. Having captured all the top fortresses in the kingdom, there's no one left to stop her.

We also see Arya and Tywin, the duo we didn’t know we needed. Every one of their scenes together is gold.

While yes there is increasingly less and less dialogue as the show goes on, that is natural for any form of television or movie of this scale as it reaches its climax. However what the show also gets better at, and which is often much harder to do, is visual storytelling. Conveying emotions, themes, and plot points purely through visuals and music. 

The best this is executed is in the spoils of war. Where for 6 seasons all i wanted to see was dany raise hell in westeros. And after about 2 minutes of it I am already unsettled by what I am seeing on screen. That battle sequence is so much deeper than just ""oh cool cgi!"" It makes you question whether or not you even want dany there. If there is too much power in her hands, and of course it drives home the ""war is hell"" theme. 

Another one i noticed on my first viewing was the mad queen arch. Since season 6 there is visual story telling in the way dany acts, and the expressions on her face that convey someone who no longer has an interest in ruling, or even as someone who cares about anyone or anything other than the desire to conquer. Yes she says things that sound great and amazing.

Okay, SPOILER starts here.

So at the end we got Dany going mad and killing everyone before eventually succumbing to the sweet embrace if eternity herself. Whether or not the going mad was warranted is a discussion long past so I'm not going to address that. We're gonna add this scene as if everything happened how it did.

So after the credits the black screen fades into a sheep running up a rocky incline. It stops every now and then to munch on grass, but immediately runs off when it's Shepard gets close (,who is revealed when the sheep moves a second time). The camera shows a wide shot of the sheep running to the top of this cliff and into what looks like a cave. The Shepard, who's clothes are ragged and old, hesitantly enters the cave as he wouldn't be able to afford another if he lost her. He creeps through the dark cavern and gets scared at the bellowing sound of a growl coming from around the corner. As scared as he was, he made his way around the corner to see a most terrifying sight: a giant living, breathing dragon. Larger than even the building his family calls home, the massive black creature raises it's massive head and looks directly at the man. Despite his terror, he is unable to leave so he observes his surroundings. Nestled on Drogon's body is the skeleton of a small woman, her platinum hair still laying atop it's skull. A bit further from the selection is a small pile of stones, all shaped the exact same: like a large scaly egg. Strangely, the dragon didn't incinerate him and turn him into the blackened charred corpses like the ones paying around him.

Why I loved her theory was because not only did it show Drogon still loved Dany, but it showed the dragons were not extinct/ going extinct when Drogon died. On top of that, it almost comes from circle from thousands of years ago when the Valaryians, who were all a simple Shepard community, first discovered dragons and their eggs and went on to conquer the known world/ build the most advanced city ever in existence. Perhaps this shepard was actually a decendant from a Valaryian and is now about to lead to the development of the here generation's Dragon Riders.

It's just a theory and probably not was m what GRRM planned but for me, that would've saved the series :) let me know what you think",2021-08-25 08:59:02

Reading ASOS, Ch 26-Jon. Jon remembers the star names taught by maester Luwin. The ones I recognize :

2. Ice dragon - Draco
3. Shadowcat - Lynx
4. Moonmaid - Virgo most likely, but can be Andromeda too.
5. Sword of the Morning - Cygnus, resembling a cross or a large sword with a large guard. Ch 30 Jon - ""the Sword of the Morning still hung in the south, the bright white star in its hilt blazing like a diamond in the dawn,"" - Deneb.
6. King's crown - Corona Borealis
7. Stallion - Pegasus
8. Red Wanderer sacred to Smith of the Seven - Mars maybe? Ygritte called it Thief, but we know only one thief in the sky, Orion. Ygritte :""when the thief was in the Moonmaid, that was a propitious time for a man to steal a woman"". So it's a wandering ""star"" that crosses the figures, ie a planet. Mars? What do you guys think?
9. 12 houses of heaven and the rulers of each - 12 zodiacs.
10. ACOK, Ch 35, Bran - Osha : ""Look for the Ice Dragon, and chase the blue star in the rider’s eye"". -Star near the back of Draco, Polaris.

I had done a pretty good job about avoiding spoilers, so even the few things I knew would happen, I had no idea when or what to look for.

I knew the mountain was going to win some big fight, but I wasn't sure if that was going to be it. In fact, I was hoping that wouldn't be it.

- The people in Braavos that have never left have only seen the back of the guardian. I'm sure there are some superstitions in the slums about seeing the front.
- I didn't realize Jason Momoa was in GoT until I started watching.
- Sir Breanne ""The Awkward"" has a dorky smile... I can relate... being a tall strong woman myself :)
- The Hound is one of the most pragmatic characters... probably chaotic neutral.
- Arya's story was my favorite. I could watch a stand-alone movie about her adventures. I wonder if there's a supercut with just her story.

After finishing the series, I started looking for the content that I had avoided for years. I'm surprised that I haven't found anything talking about Danerys' slow turn into the Mad Queen. It's almost like nobody wants to believe that she did it, but I had seen flashes of it through the whole series. Maybe it was more obvious when binging it.",2021-08-23 11:17:25

[Spoilers] Can you make a list of the most evil characters from the series?,16,p9ksvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/p9ksvm/spoilers_can_you_make_a_list_of_the_most_evil/,20,1629665848.0," 

So, for those of you who don\`t know there is a trope created by TV Tropes called Complete Monster (also known as Pure Evil). They are regarded as the very worst of the worst characters from a certain franchise. There are a lot of requirements for these trope but the main ones are the following:

1. The character has ABSOLUTELY NO REDEEMING QUALITIES. Even if a character has some redeeming qualities at the start of the story he/she could still become a Complete Monster if he/she loses them. Even one single redeeming quality is enough to disqualify a character from this trope.
2. The character in question commits horrible, atrocious crimes that are presented seriously within the story and their actions are worse than the actions of most other villains in the story. We also take into account their resources and their ability to cause harm to other people. This means that if a character has more resources (if for example he/she is a ruler that commands thousands of people), then he/she needs to comit bigger atrocities in order to stand out. If a character has less resources to harm people (for example, if he/she is a lone serial killer), then he/she qualifies if their crimes are heinous enough considering their resources. If a character\`s actions are not heinous enough by the standards of the story then he/she can\`t be a Complete Monster. The character\`s crimes must pass several different heinous standards in order for the character to count as a Complete Monster:

\- The baseline standard - This is a common standard that all villains need to pass, no matter the work they come from. This means that the villain needs to commit crimes that are worse than animal cruelty, theft, abuse (unless the abuse is REALLY extreme but that rarely happens) and trying to kill the main characters (because this is something most villains try to do).

\- The standards of the work - This means that the villain should be compared to other villains from the same work (or franchise) to see if his/her actions are bad enough to make him/her stand out. This means that a villain who comes from a lighthearted series like My Little Pony needs to be compared to other villains from My Little Pony and not to villains from grimdark franchises such as Warhammer 40000, A Song of Ice and Fire and Berserk. Similarly, a villain who comes from a work with high heinous standard should  be compared to other villains from the same franchise and not to villains that come from My Little Pony.

\- The resource standard - This means that we should also take into consideration the villain\`s resources and their ability to hurt other people as I already mentioned.

\- The system standard - This means that if a villain is part of an organization or a group, then the villain needs to be the worst member or one of the worst (if the organisation is big like the Galactic Empire for example)

3) The character\`s motivation for commiting those crimes or the character him/herself are never portrayed sympathetically and he/she has either no excuse for his/her actions or their excuse is not portrayed sympathetically. Even if the character in question has some traumatic moment that has shaped his/her personality, it doesn\`t excuse their actions and the narrative doesn\`t try to make you feel sorry for them. In short, this means that the audience is not supposed to feel ANY SYMPATHY for the character.

4) The character has enough understanding of human morality to tell right from wrong and make decisions. This means that characters who are severely mentally ill, possessed or brainwashed, made of evil or from a race or culture that can\`t comprehend morality or has an entirely different morality can\`t qualify. However, characters who are mentally ill can still qualify if they can tell right from wrong despite their mental illness (for example, the Joker).

5) The character is portrayed seriously and is not a Comic Relief (a character you are supposed to laugh at and not take very seriously). Even if the character is funny he/she can still be a Complete Monster if they are portrayed seriously despite their sense of humor. If the character is treated as a joke by the narrative itself (which often happens in kid\`s shows), then he/she can\`t be a Complete Monster.

6) The character must make AT LEAST ONE APPEARANCE in the story itself. Characters that are just mentioned by other characters and make no appearance can\`t qualify. Aside from that, if all the crimes commited by the character happen off-screen/off-page and are only vaguely described, then he/she can\`t be a Complete Monster.

7) The audience is not supposed to feel bad for a Complete Monsterr when something bad happens to him/her because their comeuppance is completely deserved and the narrative doesn\`t try to make the audience feel sympathy for the Complete Monster.

8) The character must come from a work which has at least some semblence of plot and is not pure exploitation and is more complex than ""bad guy does evil things for no apparent reason"" type of plot. A horror film or book can still contain a Complete Monster but it needs to have some plot. For this reasons films like Human Centipede and Serbian Film don\`t contain Complete Monsters because they are viewed by TvTropes as plotless exploitation even though the villains are extremely repulsive.

9) A character must meet ALL of the above mentioned criteria in order to be a Complete Monster.

Now, I will copy and paste a list of all the characters that are listed as Complete Monsters in the series:

* [Joffrey Baratheon](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GameOfThronesJoffreyBaratheon) is a dyed-in-the-wool sadist who seems to take pleasure only in fear and suffering. At first putting on a [charming face](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing), his true colors are hinted at when he begins carving up the face of Arya Stark's lowborn friend for fun, before trying to kill Arya herself for hitting him, despite the fact she's the younger sister of his fiancée, Sansa. After becoming king, however, Joffrey really comes into his own as a vicious bastard, ordering Ned Stark's execution even though it ensures a civil war with the North. Viewing Sansa as his toy, he frequently has her [humiliated, beaten and threatened with death and rape.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse) Among his many cruel acts, Joffrey has a bard choose between losing his hands or his tongue, tries to drown Ser Dontos with wine, orders a crowd of peasants executed because one threw some dung at him, forces one prostitute to beat another, possibly to death, at crossbow point, and eventually shoots Ros full of crossbow bolts just to experience what it's like to personally kill someone. The taboo of kin killing means little to Joffrey either, as he threatened to [execute his mother](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matricide) for slapping him, tried to have his uncle Tyrion assassinated, and had his bastard siblings (including [children and babies](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild)) butchered so no one would notice [how little Joffrey resembled his supposed father](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard), Robert Baratheon. In the end, Joffrey was merely a [vicious, idiot king](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat) who believed [ruling meant everyone was his to torment.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula)
* [Ser Gregor Clegane](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GameOfThronesHouseClegane), the Mountain, is [the most feared knight in Westeros](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded) and [works for](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire) Tywin Lannister and his family. A violent sadist who had once [burned his brother's face](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully) for playing with one of his toys, Gregor is introduced in the Hand's tournament where he murders another contender via splintered lance; when Loras Tyrell manages to unhorse him, Gregor slaughters his own horse for failing him and attempts to murder Loras. When Gregor's own brother interferes, Gregor tries to kill him as well. When next seen, Gregor is head of the occupying Lannister forces at Harrenhal where he selects prisoners to be tortured to death by one of his men known as [the Tickler](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician). When Harrenhal is lost, Gregor has every prisoner put to the sword, leaving hundreds of corpses for the next arrivals to find. In season 4, Gregor is seen practicing his sword skills by butchering prisoners in wholly one-sided duels before he enters into a Trial by Combat representing the Crown against Prince Oberyn Martell who wishes to force Gregor to confess to the murder of Oberyn's sister Elia and her children. When Gregor gets his hands on Oberyn, he [shoves his thumbs through the prince's eyes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream) before [squeezing his head until it explodes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadASplode), wanting to hurt the man as much as possible while he roars out his guilt in [killing the children](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild) before he raped and murdered Elia.
* [Craster](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard) is a particularly nasty [Wildling](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GameOfThronesWildlings) who resides beyond the Wall, making his living as an ally to the Night's Watch by providing them with supplies, shelter and info. Craster delights in antagonizing them, however, hiding behind the fact he's necessary to them to avoid reprisal. What makes Craster sickening is how he rules his self-given kingdom: Craster routinely [marries any daughters](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry) he has when they come of age, [beating and raping his many wives and daughter-wives](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousIncest). If they bear him sons, Craster [sacrifices them](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice) by leaving them out for the White Walkers. Craster threatens violence on those he can't simply cow into submission and relishes the lack of law beyond the Wall to simply do whatever he wants, even having the audacity to claim he is a ""Godly man"" when criticized.
* [Ramsay Snow](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GameOfThronesRamsayBolton), the bastard son of Lord Roose Bolton and the most vicious member of House Bolton, is a sadist with a knack for torture and [flaying others alive](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlayedAlive). After capturing Winterfell, Ramsay proceeded to play [twisted games](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape) with the captive Theon Greyjoy, pretending to be an Ironborn agent who comes to save Theon—killing his own men to keep up the ruse—and culminating in Ramsay bringing Theon to the Dreadfort and subjecting him to prolonged, hideous torture, including [flaying bits of him](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore) and [castrating](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingCastration) him. All that remains of Theon afterwards is a broken, obedient shell whom Ramsay dubs ""Reek."" In his spare time, Ramsay and his equally psychotic lover [Myranda](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMistress) release girls into the woods to hunt them for sport, also using the girls to feed Ramsay's savage hounds. When Ramsay makes Theon negotiate a surrender with other Ironborn, Ramsay guarantees their safety, [only to have them flayed alive](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied) and displayed as gruesome trophies. After marrying Sansa Stark, Ramsay rapes her on the wedding night and continues to [sexually and physically abuse her](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse) throughout the rest of the marriage. Ramsay cements his rule over his hold by murdering Roose and having his hounds eat his infant brother and stepmother. When he finally engages the Northern armies, Ramsay is [apathetic to the death of his own men](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves) and shoots the preteen Rickon Stark dead—moments before he reaches Jon Snow. With few matching his pointless savagery, Ramsay Snow exemplified every [negative stereotype about bastards](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard) in Westeros.
* [Lord Walder Frey](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare), head of [House Frey](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GameOfThronesHouseFrey), is a [smug](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake) old man who nevertheless appears to be little more than a doddering but harmless [pervert](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan) before the true depths of his treachery are made apparent. In alliance with Tywin Lannister and Roose Bolton, Walder organizes the [Red Wedding](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeddingSmashers) and [oversees the deaths of Robb Stark, his pregnant wife Talisa, Catelyn, and the near-entirety of their bannermen](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/GameOfThronesS3E9TheRainsOfCastamere) in a full-on massacre whilst nonchalantly drinking from a cup of wine—for the sake of power and getting back at Robb for breaking his wedding vow. Walder coldly dismisses the life of his teenage wife once Catelyn takes her hostage with the logic of ""I'll find another"" and doesn't so much as blink when her throat is cut in front of him. Walder is entirety unrepentant about his betrayal and destructive fallout caused by it, and [cruelly gloats](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating) about his victory and the new position of power he's snagged for the rest of his role in the series. Walder is a coward and a backstabber who considers even age-old traditions like [guest right](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality) irrelevant in the face of personal gain, and is rightfully detested even in the cutthroat world of Westeros for his treason.
* [Karl Tanner](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy) is a [Night's Watch](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GameOfThronesNightsWatch) member who takes the [taboo of oathbreaking](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOathBreaker) to extreme measures by instigating a mutiny in Craster's Keep which claims the lives of Lord Commander Jeor Mormont and all of his loyalists. After taking over at Craster's Keep, Karl rules with an iron fist, drinks wine from the skull of the very commander he betrayed, relishes his past as a [Psycho for Hire](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire), and pressures his men to rape and brutalize Craster's wives/daughters, who are [too terrified of Karl's violent outbursts](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded) to oppose him. When one of Craster's wives steps in with the last-born baby boy, Karl's first reaction is to [attempt to kill it](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild) for not wanting any more mouths to feed. He's only stopped when the wives point out that they leave them as a sacrifice for the White Walkers, so he has that done instead. Once his men captures Bran and his group, Karl abuses Bran and menaces Meera in order to get him to speak, later attempting to gang-rape Meera with his men while [forcing her brother to watch](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch). When encountered by Jon Snow, Karl shows nothing but pride for his treachery and relishes the time he and his men had as free men, [despite mocking Craster for the same lifestyle a while back](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite).

The most evil characters according to these criteria are Joffrey, Gregor, Craster, Ramsay, Walder Frey and Karl Tanner. The other characters are not listed because they don't meet the criteria to be called Pure Evil.

Obviously this is not necessarily a new idea, but I wanted a good discussion about it and get some of my ideas into the world. Essentially the idea of a story based on a random person sent to the night's watch and having to go out into the frozen north alone to fight skeletons, dire wolves, and bandits sounds like a great setting for a Fromsoft game. Basically Ashes of Ariandel but a full game and a different world of lore and implications. A simple criminal getting caught and forced to wade through horrors and defeat God-like beings with only survival as motivation thematically fits the DS games. 

Im not sure about the proper ""period"" it would take place in, but maybe early in the nights watch creation, or even beforehand. My knowledge of lore isnt the best, but it would need to be at a time when the white walkers and other fantastical creatures and beasts weren't as rare as they are in ASOIAF. 

Combat would be self explanatory from Dark Souls, as well as some major bosses (Giants, white walkers, dragons). Stuff like special weapons you need to kill certain bosses isnt rare (looking at you storm ruler) but then again you could just make all the weapons obsidian or Valyrian steel. Where your character comes from chooses your starting build is already a feature (pickpocket from Kings Landing is high dex for example).

I wrote these thoughts as I watched, when I had a thought worth writing I would jot it down in my notes and now I'm copying and pasting them here with a bit of tune-up of course. 

Season 8

I wish we'd gotten to see more of Arya using her faces and more of bran doing three eyed raven stuff

Grey worm is going to die. Characters don't have heart felt moments where they make a promise to a loved one and then live to fulfill it. 

I would've loved to see Gren at winterfell fighting the dead
Are the gods real? The Lord of light and many faces seem to be real but what about the rest?

I would've liked to see more of the Dothraki preparing although they didn't change much, just putnoon warmer clothes

The clothing that the unsullied wear would not keep them warm, if GOT winter is anything like ours they'd be freezing

I noticed no one in the north wears anything to keep their ears or nose warm, a simple hood is the most we've gotten

I wonder if being a Targaryen is the reason Jon gets along with the dragon or if tits just because he's a gentle man 

How does the night king have so many men that look the same and how do some of them have hair and why doesn't the night king have hair?

I hope the night king can speak, that'll make things a lot more interesting
Ghost was alive this whole time? I don't think he made more than three appearances since season 5

The dothraki having their weapons lit up like that was awesome, one of my favorite scenes and then seeing their light charge was equally as cool

I hope ghost doesn't die, if he does it should be by Jon's side

How did the red woman survive and is she with the army of the dead? She's very mysterious

Ed just died for Sam. I liked Ed and I had hoped to see him live

They can't win this. The dead gave just gotten over the wall and there are countless more coming

It's a shame Cersi's troops aren't at winterfell, I'd like to see the mountain fighting 

Holy shit episode 3 was crazy, I thought our favorite characters would die, I didn't write too many thoughts during the end of the episode because I completely forgot about it. Arya getting the killing blow was cool but I think it should've been Jon

Cersi can easily win now. There is 1 dragon and over half of the northern army was killed, I hope Arya can take her faces and assassinate her

Grey worm didn't die which is a pleasant surprise

Tyrion trying to reason with Cersi is pointless, she is a monster and she'd kill everyone before she steps down as queen

I have a feeling grey worm will either kill the mountain or be killed by him 

The thing Missandei said before she died, I thought that was the word that made the dragon breath fire and if it is why didn't drogon do it? That or she was telling them to burn the city

Many innocent people are going to die and Cersi sadly won't suffer for it

I've lost more and more faith in Daenerys as the shows progressed and I hope she can make a comeback but I think Jon is being set up to take her down in a heart breaking way

Varys is a smart man so I believe putting his rings in the cup and burning the paper was a message for his little birds. I'm not too sure about the paper being burnt as I think it could've been to throw them off but I definitely believe the rings are significant

Daenerys killing the innocent was the turning point for me, she's killing as many people as she can.

The soldiers are killing everyone, why? Daenerys just turned the people against her and set up Jon to take the throne perfectly

Cersi deserved a much worse death, rarely do I think anyone deserves to suffer but she deserves the torture theon received and Jamie died with her. He didn't need to die but his love for her killed him

2 of my guesses for who will die were right and four of my theories for how people will die were pretty close if not dead on, I guessed that Cersi and oberyns wife would die I just didn't know how or when and the close to dead on guesses were Theon will either be killed because of his betrayal or he'll die because he was trying to redeem himself. Jorah will either disappear or die for Daenerys. Little finger will die because Jon or sansa kill him or he'll die trying to prove his loyalty. Jamie will die for Cersi or with her.
 
If Jon and grey worm fought who would win? They're both excellent fighters and I'd love to see the fight although I'd probably be upset about how it ends 

Why did Daenerys completely destroyed King's landing? It feels out of character for her, yes she changed but she became a tyrant pretty quick

Tyrion is going to partly blame himself for Jamie's death

Arya and Jon approaching the stairs, through the crowd of people is resembling neds death. Arya is stuck in the crowd and her family member is up in front of everyone preparing to die, Jon's still walking up the steps as I type this so this is nothing more than speculation 

Maybe it isn't possible to be a ruler or to overthrow one without killing innocent people but it's definitely possible to do as little damage as possible

Jon still supports Daenerys but he's conflicted so here's hoping he makes the right choice

Even if Jon kills Dany her army wouldn't follow him, they'd kill him. 

I thought varys rings were a sign to his birds to send out his message about Jon's true name because he knew he'd die so why take off your jewelry when it doesn't make a difference? 

I wasn't too upset earlier but the more this finale episode goes on the more I'm irritated. Daenerys knows that being the queen of nothing doesn't matter, she's sitting on the throne but the people won't accept her. She's the ruler of ashes and now she's either manipulating Jon or she's gone crazy 

Why are people so stubborn and ignorant in this show, I don't have names or references to the moments I'm talking about because I didn't jot then down when they happened as I thought they were isolated events but they're not. The only people I can really say for sure are ignorant and stubborn are Stannis, Cersi, and Dany. Obviously if they weren't ignorant and were reasonable there'd be less issues and we'd have better endings with less drama but it's still annoying

Melting the throne was an amazing thing to do, although the fact that drogon knew it was the right thing to do is strange since it's not been alive long enough to fully understand it's evilness. I do like it though, the throne has caused countless and pointless death and misery

What will the unsullied and Dothraki do now that Dany is not only dead but her body is also missing? 

This small circle of people looks like it could be an interesting government

Robin had a much smaller role then I expected.

I think I should've time stamped these thoughts, they're chronological but if you aren't watching the show with me and you haven't seen it since it ended you probably won't get too much of what I'm thinking

I wonder if there has been a three eyed raven as king before bran. I also think he'll be the best king there ever was only rivaled by the potential of Jon.

The north being independent should be how the rest of the houses operate. Only making alliances when they need to.

What will happen to the body of Dany?

Jon is really getting a shitty deal. He potentially saved everyone and now he's suffering for it. He deserves better and he won't get it, a sad truth. He's suffered a lot, killing the woman he loves, having the woman he loved killed in front of him, saving countless people and receiving no thanks

What would have happened to the free folk had Dany not been killed? Would she have killed them to let them be?

Why is the nights watch still around and who do they serve also who is the lord Commander since Ed died

If bran knew that he'd be king, and around a million people would die why didn't he save anything? I can only assume this is the best possible outcome for the future of the world and it's people

Where will bran rule? 

Will kings landing be rebuilt? 

Arya is headed west of westros and it hadn't occurred to me that those people have no idea of the shit that just went down for the past few years, they had no idea the world could've ended, and we have no idea what they were going through

I think this series could've gotten a star wars treatment. Elaboration and exploration upon the world and people of it. I'd love to see how bran does as king and how the world turns out after he's dead.

How long was the time skip? Long enough to rebuild kings landing or build a similar establishment

Tyrion has been the hand to three rulers, Joffery, Daenerys, and now Bran. 

Why/how is Bron still alive? I expected Tyrion to kill him after threatening him and his brother

The bickering between the kings table I guess you'd call it was definitely amusing

All of neds children are in a position of power. Jon looks to be more commander again, Sansa is the Queen of the north, Bran is the king, and Arya has her own ship. I imagine ned would be proud of his children.

It is currently 12:00 am and I've justed finished the show. For me it was an 9/10, 1 point off for the vast mystery that was left and although I didn't like the out of character actions of Daenerys I think it was a fairly good ending. I loved the show and greatly enjoyed each episode, it's put me on to Kit Harington and Sophie Turner. (I just found out that Sophie's debut in acting was game of thrones and holy shit is she good, if that's the beginning of her career I'll enjoy finding out where else it goes)

People still don't know that Tyrion didn't kill Joffery?

Who are the best fighters in GOT skill wise? This is a discussion I'd like to have with you guys. I say the candidates are Arya, Brienne, Jon, Oberyn, Bron, jaqen h'ghar and maybe grey worm. I think Arya is the best (rivaled by Jaqen) but if she were to fight the mountain at the end of the series I don't believe she'd win, Brienne would have the best chance although I imagine she would also lose but that doesn't make the mountain the most skilled, he's a freak of science & maybe magic and he doesn't rely on his skill whatsoever. The most dangerous man in GOT was the night king, the most dangerous fighter was the mountain, and my favorite was Jon. 

Now to talk about my favorite characters but first the Honorable mentions: Sansa, Missandei, Rob stark, podrick, Brienne, the hound, Grendy, and Shireen.

1. Jon snow, he reminds me of captain America. He's an honorable man doing what he think is best for the peoples saftey. He trusted the free folk and helped them unlike any lord Commander ever 

2. Tyrion Lannister, he's funny, clever and has good intentions. His life has been a struggle both emotionally and physically and I sympathize with him. Hes also brave and looks good with facial hair. He's loyal to the people like varys, he knows when to do the right thing and be stayed true to himself until the end

3. Daenerys Targaryen, being the breaker of chains is a big plus for me. Also stopping the rape and murder of innocence in her army. She's a mostly good person and her ideas of what she wants the world to be is closer to today's world than any other character has shown to strive for. I wrote these character reviews/favoritism explanations before finishing season 7, now that I've finished season 8 I see that Dany is a lot worse than I expected. I wanted to remove her from the 3rd place because of what happened in episode 7 & 8 of the 8th season but I can't. She's still a favorite

4. Arya stark she's tough, independent, and her journey was impressive as well as interesting. I expected her to die several times but was pleasantly surprised. She might even be the best fighter in GOT

5. Prince Oberyn, we didn't see much of him but we know he's a mostly kind man and he's charming. He lived and died for his sister plus he hates the Lannisters and I love that. Sadly his ego got him killed otherwise he might've taken second place on my list

6. Samwell tarly, he has a good heart and I feel sorry for him. His father hates him and the rest of his family won't stand up for him. He also cured jorah of grayscale

7. Tormund, here me out with this one. I know he's a rapist(probably), murder and thief but most of the people in GOT are terrible people. I like tormund because he's funny and his relationship/respect for Jon

8. Ned stark, he wasn't around for long but the example he set has lived on thought the series, his teachings and honor are forever remembered. He was a good man, an honorable man and I'll forever enjoy his character

9. Jamie Lannister, I don't know have much reason here. He's mostly honorable and he's merciful, he saved lady Olena from what probably would've been torture. He's also loyal which is a con as much as it is a pro.

10. Gren, for the short time he was around he was an awesome character. He defended Sam, supported Jon, and gave his life for his brothers fighting a giant.",2021-08-21 09:46:41

[SPOILERS] Jaime & Cersei,189,p8gvqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/p8gvqk/spoilers_jaime_cersei/,33,1629503648.0,"Welcome to ""I wrote down my shower thoughts after getting way too deep into a topic nobody else cares about"".

I think this has definitely been discussed at length previously by others, but here's my two cents (which I am aware that _nobody_ asked for). 

Cersei was never truly _in love_ with Jaime.

I think she learned from a young age what her life was expected to be (e.g. an obedient wife and loving mother) and we all know she obviously wanted to be more than that. 

I think she saw everything she wanted to have for herself in Jaime, and I think she was so terrified of the thought of being handed over to whoever her husband would be, she clung onto Jaime and manipulated him into loving her so that she could always have some element of control over _something_ she recognised and understood, and who would love her unconditionally, when she knew that she would perhaps have very little control in other areas of her life.

I think she was intensely jealous of everything Jaime had that she wasn't allowed (training, fighting etc.), and perhaps wanted to live vicariously through him, and the only way she knew how to keep him around was to let him become obsessed with her. 

For a start, Jaime has never been with another woman but Cersei (I'm going on the books here so let's ignore the Brienne stuff _for now_), whereas Cersei is quite happy to take others to her bed (Lancel) and admits that at first, she _did_ ""love"" King Robert until he called her Lyanna. 

If she truly loved Jaime, of course she would have shared a bed with her husband because she _can't not_, but she wouldn’t have taken others to bed. 

She isn't even overjoyed when he returns from being held captive. She's very sharp and spiteful with him, blaming him for abandoning her. There's very little understanding or forgiveness; if she loved him, she'd have been overjoyed to be reunited. Without him, she had little control or influence over anything, and so she feels as if his absence is a personal slight against her - _how could he be so selfish as to leave her alone in the Capital?_ There's very little regard for his wellbeing outside of how his return will benefit _her_. 

With regards to Jaime, he knows it's wrong to love Cersei, but he can't seem to break away from her, until _Brienne_, and I think when Brienne finally starts to show him some compassion and understanding, he begins to realise that that’s what _love_ is (whether it's romantic or platonic), and that Cersei has _never_ given him that.

I think in the next two books, we'll see Jaime finally break away from Cersei when he realises that she never truly loved him; she just loved to control him. 

If he doesn't enter a romantic relationship with Brienne, then the two will have an immensely strong friendship, and she will be the one to help him heal.

I think Jaime will be the one to kill Cersei in the end (as the Valonqar). I think he may have an internal battle regarding his feelings for her because she's twisted him so much, but I think he'll relent and realise that she's incapable of thinking about anyone but herself (assuming all her children are dead, which I think they will be).

Does Cersei love Jaime? Yes, as her brother and as her play-thing, but I do not think she is, or has ever been in love with him.",2021-08-21 05:24:08

I love that there are so many characters, therefore many people to cheer on and many to hate. Also - the show can afford to kill important characters, so you can never dismiss the possibility of any twist and turn. Glorious 6 seasons.

I can't help but be saddened by season 7 (haven't reached season 8 yet). Even binge watching isn't helping. The writing is lazy and lacks imagination, the dialogues are cringey or cliche.

Especially cheering my girl Arya on (taking away her warging was … the worst) until it was like what, why? 

But Natalie Dormer and the Great Sept getting blown us was absolutely as mind blowing to me as all the other twists that came before it. Like I rewound that at least five times with my jaw hanging open. 

The fact that there was no mention of it again. No acknowledgement of the power vacuum with the lords and head of the main religion.

He of course would set parameters and canon, but allow other authors to come in and tell stories of events from the history of the world or even what was going on in other places as the events of the novels were taking place and, lets say, word of those events reached distant lands and how various people or nations reacted to them or how things in Westeros affected OTHER parts of Westeros that weren't related in the books.

They had both lost their closest relatives, and also the loves of their life. A hurtful Danaerys went out of her castle, with eyes full of red and black marks under her eyes. Cersei, suffered much worse, for she was planning something that no one could imagine. She had figured that since Jamie died and Dany would obviously win against her, She went out for one last play, an inspired move and the Game would forever be changed.

With words of confidence from Tyrion and as the impending excitement of sitting on the throne came towards her, Danaerys and her army, the greatest army Westeros has ever seen for a house, marched in front of the gates of Westeros, whilst she rode on with Drogon  And like that the war started, All the soldiers fighting each other and chaos all around. Dany and Drogon rode high, destroying every crossbow that they could find. For the throne and for Jon, she thought. And like that, there was complete annihilation. With Cersei sitting patiently and sipping her wine, Maester Qyburn hastily entered the room."" Mam, we have got to go out"". She gave him a look, a look of contempt, sadness but an evil look. ""Do as we planned"" said Cersei to Qyburn.

As the bells rang, there was joy on Danys face. The dreams of becoming the Queen, something that she dreamt of from the youngest of age, to finally be able to break the wheel and take vengeance for her family, and for Jon, she was overwhelmed with happiness. But Cersei, the vilest monarch Westeros had ever seen had other plans. With a look towards the mountain, the mountain gave a look to the men sitting at different parts around Westeros.

BOOM! Most of Westeros was under wildfire. People running for their lives and chaos all around. The soldiers were fleeting and the building collapsed. One by one each and every area had an explosion, all due to the wildfire. Drogon swerved and flew but bricks and debris covered the skis. Dany got hurt and fell from Drogon, Only to be caught by him midair. The Game had ended with how it began after the fall of the Targaryens

With the explosion Cersei fleed, she suddenly found Qyburn and had rushed with him into the river to free far from Westeros, just as they had planned before. Her plan had succeeded. Almost. As she went on to hop on the boat, Qybrun gave a glaring smile at her, took his hand, peeled of his face, only to reveal none other than No one. Arya stark had appeared, ready to take her vengeance. Cersei filled with surprise, and horror understood that it was her end. With a dagger to the heart, The same dagger intended to kill bran, Cersei was no more.

Drogon, like any son, would do for her mother, protected her to the best of his ability, but it was too little, too late. Badly wounded, she finally reached the Throne. Thousands of bodies everyone, buildings in ruins and blood spilled everyone, it was a sight none had ever seen or could have dreamt of seeing. On her last breath, she looked at the throne, seeing her dreams and her life passing through her eyes. With one last look and taking her final breath, she closes her eyes, to which Drogon screams and burns the Iron throne.

My favorite example of this is how in the season one finale, If I remember correctly, Dany kind of just walked into the flames, and emerged with three dragons. In the novel, there’s so much buildup and added layers to her motivations that it just works so much better. In her previous chapter, she dreamt of her family, and her true destiny as the blood of the dragon. When she saw her brother Rhaegar, “The Last Dragon,” she saw herself in the visor of his helm, proving that she was actually the true last dragon. I also loved how her dragons actually acted as her babies, feeding from her breasts. It just adds so much more to the name “Mother of Dragons.” Overall, it was such a good start to the book series, and I’m excited to keep reading.

This is probably the longest post yet, hopefully season 8 will surpass it

Season 7
I like Jamie, he deserves to die but I like him at least for now. I wish he would betray Cersi and join the starks or the Targaryens but I doubt it'll happen. He'll die next to Cersi although I wouldn't be surprised if they won. People were outraged at the ending so maybe it's because they won

The Lannister soldiers Arya meets seem really cool.  But she just said she'll kill the queen so we'll see how that goes. Is Ed Sheeran the first celeb cameo?

Jon and Daenerys teaming up? Hell yeah. I don't know why people always have to bow/bend the knee to one or another and why they can't just be equal allies but Jon being under Daenerys should work out well. I hope the two of them can kill Cersi

That crossbow thing that broke the dragon skull is worrisome. I do not like it at all, I hope varys gets down whispers about it do that they're prepared

I love grey worm and I really hope he doesn't die but I already know it'll happen, every character I cherish are gonna die 

It looks like Aray is headed to winterfell, I don't think jon will be there by the time she gets there but Sansa might. When will the stark kids reunite? Will bran see any of his siblings again?

Littlefingers obsession with Sansa is gross and strange, I hope he never gets her but again this show loves doing the opposite of what I hope for

I thought Arya couldn't die because she's a little girl but I remember babies have died on screen and so did olly so she's isn't free from the chopping block

Theon and Yara might die in the water. If they do it'll be the beginning of the end for Daenerys and her army/plan

Now I feel like Cersi will win. Yara is going to due here along with theon and the dornish women will be killed by Cersi

Theon really disappointed me, more than he did Yara. 

Oberyns wife is ignorant and I hate it. She has so much pride and ignorance mixed with her pride makes it even worse. Cersi is crazy and heartless and now that she's her prisoner I imagine she'll be tortured, not like theon was. I imagine it'll be mostly psychological rather than physical

Jamie is cheeked up just as much if not more than Cersi

I know a lot of people will die in this show so here are my predictions. Arya, Cersi, oberyns wife, Tyrion, and Yara will die in ways that I don't know. Theon will either be killed because of his betrayal or he'll die because he was trying to redeem himself. Jorah will either disappear or die for Daenerys. Little finger will die because Jon or sansa kill him or he'll die trying to prove his loyalty. Jamie will die for Cersi or with her. Tormund will either die for Jon or against the night king. Grey worm will probably die when attacking the rock. Cersi might not die, I wouldn't be surprised if she survived the entire time and ended up winning.

What happened to ghost? We haven't seen him since Jon was revived so is he still alive?
Sam cured jorah, maybe he'll become the best maester

The tyrells have fallen, Dorne are out of reach. Daenerys came in with overwhelming force, they could've/would've crushed the Lannisters but they're being picked apart. Their navy has been destroyed, their dragons are no longer full proof, their support is crippled, and their enemies aren't being hit nearly as hard as they're. 

Bran gave Aray his dagger, I think she did it because she'll need it in the future, perhaps against a white walker 

The dothraki charging into battle like that was amazing, their scream is awesome

I like bron but I like Daenerys and her dragons more, if he dies I'll be sadden but not as much as if the reverse happened

Will Jon and Daenerys marry? She said she needed to marry someone and he's king of the north plus a cool guy so I don't imagine there's a better option plus he gets along with drogon

Cersi needs to be assassinated before she gets all of her soilders killed 

I wish jorah would've told Jon who cured him, it wouldn't matter much but Jon would be proud of sam

Jon might lose the support of the people and they'll suffer for it

Cersi is pregnant, the Witch said that she'll only have 3 children and GOT are really good at consistency so she'll either die or miscarry

A dragon in the undead army? Holy shit. I wonder if the other dragons will kill it, a huge arrow, or if it falls with the night king

Jon has another fake out death, not mad about it but I do wish he had more time with his uncle. Maybe bran can tell him a thing or two about what happened to him. 

Will Tyrion betray the queen? 

Will Sansa betray jon or Aray? 

Aray has become hella creepy.

Is Cersi being genuine or was she twisting an arm and trying to get her way?

I hope Tyrion doesn't die here trying to convince her different.

Little finger is manipulating and feeding into sansas worst thoughts. Arya needs to kill him before it gets out of hand

I actually wasn't expecting baelish to die and be revealed as the traitor

I also wasn't expecting Cersi to be a cunt and betray the north

Cersi is going to kill Jamie or get him killed, as I write this Gregor just stepped in front of Jamie so we'll see what happens, Jamie didn't get killed and now I hope he rides north and joins Jon

Kit Harington has some nice butt cheeks

What Jon and Daenerys just did was incest right? I think the targaryens have been doing it for a long time. This is a mind fuck that I'm not sure I like. I think the maester at castle black said something about ageon which is apparently Jon's real name so did he know the truth about Jon?

I would be content if the rest of this show was just fighting the dead army

The dead army arrives and the Lannisters aren't there, no one but the men in black and the free folk are. So many people are going to die, I knew this would end in mass death and part of me wishes I had never started the show because of that. Going into the 8thbseason and my heart will be broken a dozen times over

Why is the dragons fire blue? It should still be red/orange right? Does that mean the dead army had blue blood if any at all?

I hope tormund doesn't die here at the wall, I hope when he dies it's fighting 

Who will kill the night king? Will he even lose? People were upset about the ending I know I'll be upset if he wins so it's a plausible theory

Cersi is a dumb bitch and I can't wait to see her die. Her pride/ignorance will kill countless people, she's one of the best villians and Lena Headey did a fantastic job playing her",2021-08-19 04:44:09

It's based on medieval Europe and all that. But why are all the slaves black people or brown/olive-skinned people? In particular, the scenes when Daenerys goes around and free sall the slave cities.

It's very obvious there's no or very few white people in the slave groups and I get a very weird ""white saviour"" vibe in that scene when they all lift up Daenerys and cheer her on. 

I could buy that that these slave cities have different coloured skins because they are in different locations and are of different races, but the slave masters are all white as well (bar the one guy at Qarth who lets them in)... which seems to make no sense at all. 

Is there something to this lore-wise (I'm genuinely asking — did some foreigners from the ""white"" mainland come and capture these ""minority"" citizens or something like that?) or... is the show just being racist?

I just finished A Dance with Dragons earlier today, and I want everybody to hit me with their theories, or if anybody knows a good thread with the most popular theories, send me that way.  
My mind is mostly stuck on the letter Ramsay sent to Jon. Is Stannis actually dead? Does Ramsay actually have Mance? Do you think Jon will return to life like he did in the show?

And WHAT is Lady Stoneheart up to??

The prophecy of the three-headed dragon is really enthralling- Jon, Dany, and Young Griff, right? But after reading the first book (A Game of Thrones) it felt like I was being led to believe Robb Stark and Daenarys would be involved in some prophecy of Ice and Fire. Robb being Ice and Dany being Fire- ie A Song of Ice and Fire.

I have a feeling that Young Griff won't be successful in taking King's Landing, even if he is the best person to rule. We've seen Ned, the most honorable man, die in a dishonorable way. We've seen Tywin, the proudest man, die in a humiliating way. Hit me with your thoughts. I'm eager to discuss with somebody.

I thought this whole Lord of Light thing was evil/black magic since Lady Melisandre gave birth to Stannis' shadow baby in a cave and it killed Renly and all. And it seemed like something that's an ability from birth since I don't recall anyone saying how this skill comes about otherwise. But then Thoros of Myr comes along and he's a Red Priest just like her, only using his powers for good as far as we know (bringing Beric back from the dead over and over) while we've never seen Melisandre bring anyone to life, only kill and plot to kill.

I feel like I'm missing a lot here. From what I gathered, Thoros basically discovered the Lord of Light by accident, right? He didn't believe at all or was just praying for Beric randomly when he rose from the dead (and damn, what a shock that must've been the first time around). But all Melisandre has ever done is shady shit and she seems very good at it.

So now I'm going into season 5 and I'm just confused af by all of this because it seemed like Thoros and Beric/Brotherhood without Banners were gonna be a big deal, seeing as how they're the only ""evidence"" of what Melisandre preaches, but now they haven't shown back up and I'm starting season 5.

 I didn't except Jon to come back, we've only had 1 fake out death and the character wasn't even major (leader of the brothers without banners) When an important character was dying like Robb who was less injured then Jon they didn't survive so to see him come back was a great surprise. 

Cersi continues to manipulate Tommen and it's crazy how she can't see how it's wrong. Her redeeming quality is supposed to be how she loves her children but she doesn't.

Cersi keeps talking for Tommen and it gets more and more annoying Everytime. I was starting to like Jamie but because she's in cersi's pocket I'm starting not to like him. 

I hate the religious fanatics but I love that they're hurting the Lannisters (really just Cersi)

When will the Lannisters go after Dorne? Cersi won't let them get away with her daughters murder. 

Summer just died leaving only 2 dire wolves, Ghost and Arya's that ran off in the first season. 

The dead running through the tunnel is probably the coolest scene so far 

 I liked hodor, hoped he'd be one of the few to actually make it. 

Bran us responsible for Hodors disability, I wonder what he'll say about it

The dothraki coming up on the harpy's was an awesome sight

I hope to God that Jon doesn't lose to the Boltons. They've won twice already (against theon and Stannis) and I hope they won't win a third. 

Will Jon and Ramsay fight 1v1 and who will win if they do?

I would love to see Ramsay and tormund fight at least verbally, compare their brutality and insanity

I feel like someone on the stark team will die, I think it's between Davos, Tormund, and Rickon. Maybe sansa but I think the rest are more likely

tormund is awesome (apart from all the raping, murdering, and every other crime) I think they're showing us how cool is he is because he's going to die. But at the same time Davos us walking away from camp, maybe he'll get killed while on his walk. 

Sometimes we get a hint at what'll happen, I don't think there was one this time

Why hasn't the red woman tried to fuck Jon again to make another demon shadow to kill Ramsay? Jon has kings blood in him like Stannis and the blacksmith they were going to kill. 

I wonder if Tyrion will die at all and if so how will he go out?

Holy shit, the Bolton army is huge, Jon doesn't stand a chance. I really hope this won't be the slaughter it looks like it'll be. Who will help Jon last second, will it be the River run forces with Brienne and pod? Maybe Sansas cousin will send his forces, whoever comes to help I hope they do it quickly

Rickon is about to be killed by Ramsay's dogs, he'll run and they'll chase (Ramsay was just handed a bow so nevermind)

 The first stark child falls, who will be next?

Jon reminds me of captain America, standing against impossible odds but still not giving up

Jon fighting on the front line vs Ramsay hiding behind his men really shows the difference in their leadership

I would love to see Ramsay received similar torture to what he did to theon, he deserves worse but I don't see Jon doing it, maybe sansa will

I hated Cersi and wanted to see her die more than anything but now I'm hoping the faith will be slaughtered for their manipulation 

All of cersi's children are dead, will the starks meet the same fate?

Daenerys says she wants to rule the seven kingdoms, does that mean she wants to sit on the iron throne only or that she wants to rule all of westros? I hope that she doesn't go to war with the starks. 

I don't think Cersei knew Tommen would kill himself otherwise why have the mountain prevent him from going to the trial but things have worked out in her favor almost like she planned for it all

So far the starks have stayed my favorite, I wish we had more time with Rickon, we've come to know every stark child except for him and now we never will

1. season 4, all around great arcs and storylines for each of the characters, it’s difficult to find something to complain about with this season

2. season 6, Great payoffs for the characters and I especially liked battle of the bastards and the end with daenerys and the ships

3. season 1, really great start to the show and amazing way to establish how the show is gonna work with killing the “main” character very early on

4. season 2, very dense season with a lot of things happening, most is very entertaining to watch even thought the dense-ness of the season causes it to feel just a little sloppy

5. season 3, I never really liked half of the storylines especially with robbs feeling very slow until the amazing red wedding however, half of the storylines were great especially with the writers finally finding something to do with bran

6. season 5, ugh, it’s the same snakes, other than them the season was…alright, it kinda felt like the fever dream of got seasons to me

7. season 7, I enjoyed daenerys finally getting to westeros but it felt like a lot of the shows consistency was disappearing and characters arcs were making less and less sense

8. season 8, instead of ranting about the bad parts of season 8 like almost everyone else on earth, i’ll say the good parts about season 8, it had good cgi…theons arc was…okay

I still can't get over the last season. Game of Thrones has been my favorite show of all time. Despite the final season, I still loved the last seven of them.

I was just wondering, does rewatching the show from the beginning till the end make the last season better? I keep thinking that maybe the reason why it sucked for me was because they made us wait two years before releasing the eight season. I didn't watch the season 7 for the second time before diving into season 8. So basically, everything that happened in the seventh season was kind of a blur while I was watching the eight one.

Does that make sense? Maybe I just find season 8 to be a bad season only because it didn't feel connected to the seventh season. Or is it really a shitty season?

By the way, which story was better in your opinion: the one in the books or the one in the show? I'm planning to read the books as well once I have free time.",2021-08-16 11:07:00

The way she treats Jon, saying he should have been the one who fell from the tower instead of Bran, is utterly despicable. Also I find it interesting that she's the one initially pushing Ned to accept King Robert's offer to go to King's Landing and become Hand of the King. In contrast, I actually liked her a lot more in the show. There's a significant amount of vitriol towards Jon from her that is a step further from the TV show (at least IMO).",2021-08-14 01:30:52

Audio description is an audio option that adds narration to the audio providing information for visually impaired and blind people.


For example ""John walks into the room and sits on the sofa...""


It should be in the audio language settings of the bluray or dvd if it is there.

How did Hagar get the coin back after Arya put it in the water and how did he know it was there in the first place?

I feel bad for tommen, he has two people manipulating and tearing at him. He can't trust his wife or his mother and he has no one else. I hope he's not killed because of it. 

I assume Cersi is somewhat happy Joffery died, she wanted to be in control and I doubt he'd ever allow it, Cersi wouldn't have been able to manipulate him like she does Tommen and making orders behind Jofferys back wouldn't have been tolerated. 

6 episodes in and still nothing about bran.

I genuinely thought Sansa would be able to break reeks brainwashing. 

I hope Stannis can take the north but if this show has taught me anything it's that everyone is on chopping block and anything is possible (he did not. I believed in him and he fumbled everything.)

Is the red haired lady full of shit? She's done 1 thing that proves her reliable, creating the shadow but she either can't or won't bring back the dead. She's ruined Stannis life and I'm starting to doubt her, his daughter was killed for nothing because of her manipulation.

Is Arya gonna stay blind or will the god of many faces heal her?

Seeing Cersi humiliated was great, I only wish the humiliation would humble her but I don't think it will 

I knew Jon wouldn't have a hero's death but I'm hoping be does. I'm hoping the red haired lady can save him, she claims to see the future and we've seen people that practice her religion have been brought back before. 

End of season 5 and bran wasn't in a single episode.

- can be self-centered, intense, and bold

• Targaryen: California
- radical, fearless, and controversial 

• Martel: Louisiana 
-free-spirited, lively, and rowdy

• Tyrell: Florida 
- seems cheerful and laid back, but has more power than let on 

• Baratheon: Texas
- conservative, fiery/aggressive, and steadfast

For me:


1. I loved the scene when Cersei and Tyrion actually had a moment during their conversation before stannis came where she talked about if she wonders if this is price for loving jamie and how the targaryens got away with it. I wish there was one more after he joins with dany where they each show they a little hurt in how there on opposite sides of the war. (Their last conversation was good but not exactly the vibe I wanted) 


2. One more convo with Varys and little finger near the end when LF was about to scheme Arya ands Varys was starting to feel jon was the best. It would have been crazy if Varys said something along the lines of how is your grand plan going and LF said everything is on track, ands Varys responded something like mine too. It would have showed their power in the game, their two conflicting philosophies, ands get people into thinking what their master plans have been and are.

3. Dany and Cersei having a show down. Preferably after dany storms kings landing, so Cersei could have had one big blow to dany, showing their parallels with each other, admitting her wrongs but asking her to look around ands answer who is actually more of a villain and danger to people (even if you disagree)",2021-08-12 18:54:31

I read that one season equals one year in the series. And I read that Loras said in season 1, that Tommen was 8 years old. That would mean that Tommen was 14 when he died in season 6.

A different source - a Wiki in my language - wrote that Tommen was 19 in season 6. I can not imagine that.

I find it weird because other guessings of the age seemed to be pretty acurate, telling that for example Bran was 17 in season 8 or that Margaery was 14 at the beginning of the series (meaning she was 20 in season 6).

Ok, just to rant a bit. But isnt Edmure moment at the series finale kind of idiotic and doesnt make sense? The character isnt really the brightest. or the best strategist, politician, warrior etc. but like why he would want to be king? when the war of the five kings is the reason almost all of his family is dead or fucked up in a way. He probably was going to nominate someone else. Maybe not, my problem is the situation itself and how is written. 

It seems they put it there to cut down the tension and make a few laughs and make Sansa seem more powerful (and the scene really doesnt achieve any of this) Yeah I know season 8 is all over the place and Edmure was kind of a joke since he was introduced, but he spent years on a dungeon, give the guy some slack, and this is just stupid and out of the blue for the character, story etc. They should have cut it out that. It just makes the character worse, and really if it wasnt for this scene almost anyone wouldnt mock him. Also what a waste on Tobias Menzies, they should had give him a villain role or well write Edmund better. I read here that his character is way better in the books.",2021-08-11 04:58:55

People really quickly made me realize that there are too much loose ends in S4 for it to be a satisfying ending.

However, this is not the case for S6. Granted, it would've been more of an open ending than S8 *shudder* was, but I wonder if it could have worked. 

So for reminder of where the mains plots are at this point :

-Samwell arrives at the Citadelle

-Arya leaves the faceless men and avenges her family 

-Bran learns Jon's true parentage 

-The Starks finally got Winterfell back and Jon is named King in the North (it's also imply that Sansa might not be too happy about that and LF seems more than happy to take advantage of that)

-Cersei exploded the Vatican with the HS, the Tyrell - except Olenna and her other ennemies. Tommen kills himself and Cersei seizes the Iron Throne

-Dany makes Tyrion her hand and they sail to Westeros with the Tyrell and the Martell's forces behind them


So, do you think an open ending like this would have worked ? Do you think most fans would have been satisfied and individually what would you have think of it ?

(Sorry for asking again this similar question, I'm just really thinking hard about GOT's terrible ending lately and I can't help but wondering that if the show was doomed to fail this spectaculary given who was in charge of it, was there a way to prevent the damage the last two seasons did ?)

[EDIT] : Alright I think it's clear now. Game of Thrones couldn't have ended at the end of S4 nor at the end of S6, but what about S7- No I'm joking 😂😂
This is a story that needs a complete ending tying all the storylines into something that makes sense and is faithful to this universe we fell in love with.
Thanks for all these answers:))",2021-08-11 04:33:57

GoT as an allegory for our experience with Covid,0,p1xqpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/p1xqpd/got_as_an_allegory_for_our_experience_with_covid/,3,1628627827.0,"Our experience with Covid shares common themes with Game of Thrones……

The white walkers are basically a metaphor for Covid-19; in a simple/boiled down sense, they both kill people and multiply/spread (except Covid does it in reverse order and doesn’t kill everyone it touches). In late 2019 the white walkers were hanging out with the wildlings north of the Wall (which hopefully that was not taken as racist b/c I do not intend to imply anything about Chinese people and am simply trying to stay in theme) and in 2020 the white walkers broke through the Wall. They spent the last year pummeling northern Westeros, ravaging towns and villages but didn’t completely decimate the area.

Jon Snow (masks, social distancing, testing, healthcare workers and a tumultuous learning curve in hospital medicine) has been fending off the White Walkers as best as he can but not all of Westeros has been fighting with him. Some Westerosi like Cersei Lannister (Republican politicians/Fox News) have been fighting against Jon Snow, and have even managed to get their enthusiasts to follow suit. After taking severe damage early on, Jon Snow regains some control over Westeros and is able to keep the White Walkers at bay. But after losing a few battles here and there, the White Walkers change the tide and begin to tighten their grip on Westeros again. Luckily for Jon, Danaerys (vaccines) and her dragons (the scientists who created the vaccine) show up just in time to swoop him up and retreat to safety before being overrun, but the damage has already been done as the army of White Walkers is further strengthened by the arrival of Night King (the Delta Variant).

Jon Snow retreats to Winterfell (our immune systems?) and prepares for the upcoming battle with the White Walkers and Night King, hoping that Danaerys and her dragons would soon come back after flying south to convince Cersei and her followers to join forces, which we all knew was a fools errand because Cersei suuuuuuucks so bad and should never have been trusted. Now the Night King is descending on Winterfell and there are people still loyal to Cersei who not only refuse to aid Denaerys, her dragons or Jon Snow, some of them are still actively fighting against the heroes of Westeros. 

It goes further…Cersei loyalists and indigent Westerosi believe that Danaerys can prevent all of the White Walkers from entering Winterfell entirely right this very second. They don’t understand that what Danaerys does is more like reinforcing the inner defense of Winterfell with the help of Jon Snow, while hiring a bunch of Hodors (RIP) to guard the exterior. Eventually, the plan was for Danaerys (the vaccine) and Jon Snow (masks etc) to fortify Winterfell (immune system) so that any White Walkers (Covid original) who made it through would be weak enough and in small enough numbers to not do any noticeable damage, but then the Night King (delta variant) showed up. While Danaerys is not currently able to defeat the Night King, she can prevent him from mortally wounding most of the Northmen and women within Winterfell until Arya and her Valyrian Dagger is able to sneak attack the Night King and shiv him into oblivion.  Arya and her Valyrian are metaphors for a united Westerosi collectively fighting the White Walkers with the strength and wisdom of Jon Snow, Danaerys and her dragons similar to how the first men and children of the forest teamed up to best a previous army of White Walkers (such as small pox or polio).

Winter is here. Don’t listen to or be like Cersei, she’s the worst. Don’t fight against Jon Snow, pre- last two episodes Danaerys or her dragons, that’s just dumb and won’t weaken the White Walkers enough to send them back into their thousand year slumber. Let Arya and her Valyrian Dagger deliver the final blow to the White Walkers and Night King to keep us alive long enough for George RR Martin to finish his last book. The End.",2021-08-11 02:07:07

I have a question about Ned: 

How did Ned realise that Jaime was the father of Cersei’s kids? 

I understand how he realised that they were not Robert’s kids by looking at that book and checking the hair colours etc. But after that, how did he conclude that it was Jaime who fathered the kids? When I watched that season one episode many years ago, I didn’t question this probably because as a viewer I already knew the situation and I guess this made me not question things further (kind of a psychological reaction). 

But when I think about it further, I actually can’t understand how Ned made this link. Even if I think, ok maybe it’s because he thought only two blonds would create blond kids (going by the hair colour again), then it could still be any blond person? I mean, Jaime and Cersei were close, but then again, it is natural for twins to be close (in normal life as well, without the incest thing). 

Keep in mind, I didn’t read the books, I am just going by the show. So I’m thinking, is the relationship between Cersei and Jaime more visible in the court than they think in the books? Did Ned also hear some rumours like that? Are they more to it in the books? Because again, it feels like a pretty big jump to assume that twins would be in an incest relationship, without eliminating all other possible options before. 

I googled this question and read some discussions in a few other forums, but I wasn’t exactly satisfied with the answers and I am curious what this subreddit is thinking. Plus, I want to actively participate in the discussion if I have any questions arising from the answers. I did a bit of search in this subreddit and couldn't find a related discussion either, but if you know a thread in this subreddit where this question was extensively discussed, please feel free to share the link and sorry for repeating it again.

Ok. Hi folks! I just finished rewatching the entire series and this weekend, I was randomly venting about my beef with some of the kills and started what I’m calling the “correct” s8 kill list. 😂 Curious if other people have a running list of proposed corrections for s8, too? Anywho, here are mine so far, in random order:

Brienne should have killed Cersei. Why i’m right: she’d become Queen Slayer to Jamie’s King Slayer. Then, he’d probably feel weird about it and they’d fight again, but he either can’t bring himself to actually kill her or she maims him and flees out of guilt, because honor has guided her whole life, but now she’s a “disgraced” knight.

Jamie should live. I’m right because it’s just as shocking as Bran living all this time despite what he did. He gets to live with alllllll his guilt and be haunted the same way Cersei was haunted by the witch who told her the fortune about all her kids dying.

I was, personally, annoyed by how difficult it was to (re)kill the Mountain. So, the “correct” fight should’ve started as either the Hound vs. the Mountain, Ellaria from Dorne realizing his eyes/head could be destroyed, then Grey Worm avenging Missandei *OR* Ellaria getting there first—since she was already being held captive—then Grey Worm, then Clegane *OR* Ellaria, Clegane and then Grey Worm—making Grey Worm the unlikely outsider champion just like Pedro Pascal’s character was the unlikely outsider champion. They probably still all die…

Dany kills Tyrion for freeing Jamie. I hate this. But I think Tyrion and Varys were almost too smart/good/actualized characters to survive in the end. This might somewhat mirror the Lannisters killing Ned — piling on to Jamie’s grief.

Yara should’ve gotten to kill her uncle. It felt like such a cheat that she didn’t.

Melisandre doesn’t die at Winterfell following the fight against the Army of the Dead. Instead, she either kills Dany *or* kills Drogon(!!!)

Dany kills Jon Snow in hand-to-hand combat—or, more accurately—sword-to-back (like Jamie vs the Mad King), requiring Melisandre to revive him again.

I've probably watched every episode between 10-20 times, as I play the series over and over in the background while I code. However, these 7 things drive me nuts--in no specific order--and I was just curious if anyone else shared these views or if I'm just bananas.

1. Character nicknames. Some just seem god-awful in that I don't think they'd ever be actual monickers IRL. Aegon - Egg,  Danarys- Dany, Baelish- Littlefinger. There are others. Sidenote... why does Baelish's voice grow creepier and creepier as the show progresses?
2. All of the screaming throughout every fight. I'm more than aware this is a shot towards realism, but it doesn't change the fact it becomes annoying. Obviously, Brienne takes the cake here.
3. Every time a dragon enters a scene, a chorus of men or women sing ""AAAAAHHHHHH ooooh AAAHHHHH"" in the background. Seriously?
4. The unnecessary and revolting desire to make the show as disgusting as possible at times. The winner is a draw between Mormont's pus turning into runny eggs and the lovely scenes in which we get to hear all the citadel's maester's take a dump in a 10-second span.
5. The excessive use of gore. Again, I'm aware this was Martin's desire for realism. It doesn't mean that we, as spectators have to see someone's entrails every episode.
6. The songs sung within the show. The Rains of Castemere, ""And now the rains weep o'er halls."" It just seems like the most pretentious line I've ever heard, maybe because I've heard it 10,000 times now? I really love the Bear and the Maiden Fair, ""From there to here, from here to there,"" or ""I've tasted the Dornishman's wife, ooooohhhh IIIIII've tasteeeddddd...."" ??? Why?
7. The fact that I can't read Martinn's prose. I've read over 100 fantasy fiction novels and my favorites I've read more than 10x each. Yet, I just can't stay focused enough to read his work. I can't make it 2 paragraphs without being pulled out of my imagination and saying to myself, ""What?

But books aside, let's only talk about the show here and imagine that D&D decided to end it at the events of the S4 finale ?

For reminder at this point in the show this is where the main plots were at:

\-Tyrion killed Tywin and flees King's Landing to join Daenerys

\-Sansa becomes LF's apprentice

\-Arya sails to Bravos to join the faceless men

\-Jon buries Ygritte (well he burnt her corpse but you get what I mean)

\-Stannis arrives at Castle Black

\-Daenerys locks her children away

\-Brann finds the Three-Eyed-Raven

Do you think this kind of ""there-is-still-so-much-to- unpack-with-these-characters-but-it- still-feels-like-a-closure-to-their-stories"" ending would have worked ?

Do you think the viewers as a whole would have been satisfied ? Would it have stirred a controversy like the real ending to the show did ? And individually, what would you have thought of it ? I'm very curious so don't hold back your thoughts !

EDIT : Thank you for all the answers, I think I can safely say that after reading the comments I realize the answer to my question is pretty obvious:))

I did some light research about this theory online but not too much, and opinions/thoughts are welcome to either dispute/support this theory but basically; the PWWP/AA is not Jon Snow/Aegon Targ., but Drogon. Yea, the dragon. I came to this idea because: 

 1) the entire ‘the dragon must have 3 heads’ prophecy; Daenerys gave birth to literally 3 dragons, one of which is Drogon.  

2) the PWWP will wield a sword of fire—Drogon (and all dragons in the series afaik) uses fire as his weapon (or, ‘sword’).  

3) the Dosh Khaleen told Daenerys that her son would be Azor Ahai, the Stallion who would Mount the world—Drogon is Daenerys’ son and he could be interpreted as a stallion since Dany does ride him into battle/in general. 

During the series, other names such as the ‘Son of fire’ can be used to describe the PWWP—Drogon was given life during a fire. I know the PWWP is supposed to pull a sword, named Lightbringer, from flames and use it to save the world, and I am not sure how that incorporates into the theory here, but Drogon is the one to “save” the world from the Iron Throne, as he melts it.  ",2021-08-08 02:23:58

Jaime Lannister, that inbreeding, attempted child-murdering turd, really stole my heart through seasons 2 and 3. He’s so damn arrogant but it’s like Brienne tamed him and you see he just needed to be around people outside of his crazy ass family. He’s really sweet when he wants to be. I can’t believe now I used to hate him. I’m not even that bothered he shoved Bran out of a tower anymore.

I am ashamed to admit this considering he’s far old enough to be my father but Stannis is hot. There. I said it. In Westeros it wouldn’t even be that weird.

Bronn’s another one I just…he’s low key scuzzy but not in the worst way. He’s charismatic enough to outweigh that. 

I was also straight up in love with Robb the first time I watched the show as a teen but now, all of 5 years later, his father is my one true love. Go figure.

Hello. I am a PhD student in an information science program, writing a dissertation on comparing the individual differences between fandoms. For this purpose, I have created an exploratory survey designed to gather data on various fandoms. If you consent to this survey, you will be asked to identify your favorite franchise (In this case, Game of Thrones, or A Song of Ice and Fire). Your answer will then be incorporated into the text of all the questions, thus making your version of the survey into one about the Game of Thrones/ASOIAF fandom. It is hoped that this survey will eventually lead to a greater understanding of the individual differences between various fandoms. By posting here, I hope to gain a healthy sample of Game of Thrones fans. The link to the survey follows.

I was also thinking that this series and franchise was created in the most realistic way possible, and deconstructing every major trop in sword and sorcery and fantasy storys is a reason Martin wrote the books and show war is not always about glory

 If this was any other story, Jaime would even be the King or at least have some claim because he killed the Mad King, the villain in that moment, and would be cherish by all the kingdom because in the end he did what was right. Or at least he would be the most cherished knight of the seven kingdoms. I remember even Tywin bust Jaime's balls for being the Kingslayer in a moment, dont remember in what episode exactly and he told him Aerys wanted his head and wanted to blow up Kings Landing cause mad mad king is mad, but at that point didnt anyone of them expected Aerys would do some crazy thing like that?

Welcome to the quarterfinals of The Reddit Tourney to determine who is the best fighter from Game of Thrones.

It's simple, characters will be pit in 1v1 contests and you have to vote on who you think would win that fight. Winners progress to the next round.

VOTE HERE: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScM4tANOK2XDIP_vigjtzvlWXgsbalU-3ZwGInL0iITfsmiXg/viewform?usp=sf_link

VIEW THE FULL DRAW HERE: https://challonge.com/thereddittourneyqfs.svg

The numbers shown in the draw represent the percentage of total votes. There were 117 responses for round 3.

A few notes:

The draw is comprised of all the main characters, as per the wikipedia page, plus some others. Sorry if i've missed out anyone else you'd have liked to have seen but i needed to keep it to 64 entrants in order to avoid byes in the draw. Apart from spacing out some of the obviously best fighters the draw has been randomised.

Some characters fighting abilities change a lot over the course of the show (eg J Lannister or Arya) or were more renowned fighters in the lore of the show but it's not shown on screen (Robert Baratheon), in these cases feel free to choose whichever version of that character you like.

They can use whatever weapon, like how in the Mountain vs the Viper they could turn up with whatever weapon they liked, but...

NO MAGIC! It may be worth doing a tourney in the future that includes magic if this one goes well but for now we wont allow magic because it just confuses things.

Ultimately you're just trying to answer the simple question: Who would win in a fight between these two characters?",2021-08-05 23:48:47

[No Spoilers] I have problems with Tolkien Fans bashing GRR Martin and other recent fantasy authors doing more Rated R stuff because not only as attempts been done before n the genre and old mythology has them but plenty of works across mediums including high art stuff done it before Tolkien died,1,oxfllg,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/oxfllg/no_spoilers_i_have_problems_with_tolkien_fans/,11,1628032872.0,"I'm gonna start off with by stating two years before Tolkien's death, a 1971 MacBeth move was released. Highly praised by critics and considered easily one of the best adaptations as well as perhaps the most famous movie of the play at least among American audiences. IN this version, not only is open nudity is shown but there is far open blood and gore including a beheading scene of the tragic protagonist with a lot of blood splatter. Not only is he killing o children and other civilians shown onscreen without sanitizing it, but this incarnation even shows an open gangrape scene where a peasant girl is screaming as she's being penetrated while the bandits are all laughing like its a game.

Now this was released 2 yeas before Tolkien's death..........

Which why I think its a bit tiresome of how not just A Song of Ice and Fire and GRR Martin and recent authors who do a far darker and gorier take of fantasy (in a lot of case still remaining at PG-13 content and using the black and white morality Tolkien gets criticized for by modern audiences) keeps getting bashed for turning the fantasy genre into ""pulp"" fiction.

News flash while they remain more discreet about the details or at least don't go to the far extent Tolkien did, fantasy authors before him and even his contemporaries had already skirted around stuff like child trafficking, torture, if not even directly touched it.

To put Howard as an example, I just read my first Conan story ever and without putting spoilers a queen is sent to a palace dungeon afer her city fell. The text avoids directly saying anything but its not too hard to infer the queen was tortured and probably raped. ANd the rest of the story openly states stuff like humans being captured and sold into slaery for profits by the new rulers of the city.

Now let me comment on Martin. I am in no way siding with Martin's fandom and I actually think Martin is not just overrated and a pretty bad writer. Specifically concerning his very sexual and bloody setting, I actually even support people who thinks he's gone mainstream in attracting audiences through shock and awe and is at the core pretty pulp in style. SO I actually agree with attacking Martin as exploitive.

But I think a lot of fans of Tolkien goes to far in attacking Martin and authors who's been following the Rated M For Mature (Rated R equivalent for videogames for those who don't know trend) in attacking them as being weak writers who only can grip readers by shock value and making comments like how sheltered this generation of humans are because they find rape and genocide with bloody fight scenes as appealing and fail to understand how horrifying these stuff are and other comments of that nature. I think its very shortsighted, elitist, and not just insulting but even outright ignorant.......

Because its not just contemporaries of Tolkien who wrote stuff in the fantasy genre touching Game of Thrones type of stuff, but plenty of mythology including the stuff Tolkien read and loved already did ASOIAF content centuries erlier.

I just finished Homer for the first time. What saw in The Illiad in particular genuinely surprised me. To start off the battle scenes are full of description of blood spilling, open wounds from sword slashes and spear stabs, decapitations of the limbs, and brains bashing out in bits because of weapons smashing the skull, so much more that is literally at the level of Bravehart and the recent Spartacus TV show. We aren't even counting the morally wrong stuff like Achilles having a female slave where is implied he has control over her and can do anything he wants including force her to give him sexual favors.

La Morte D'Arthur has a lot of treachery and backstabbing to bring a story that Tolkien specifically loved. Even Tolkien's favorite tale Beowulf has a brutal fight scene where a humanoid monster's arm is cut off by Beowulf pulling it with brute force.

And we don't even need to stick to fantasy and mythology specifically or even just books and live stage plays like Tennessee Williams and Shakespeare. In addition to 1971 MacBeth movie, you can see so many stuff across high art works in other mediums. To put just one example, the drama movie A Streetcar Named Desire has a rape scene just before its conclusion (even though it flashes out in the middle of the attack). This is considered one of the best movies of all time and with acting so powerful its not just Marlon Brando's breakout role, but its Vivien Leigh's second Academy Award win as best actress. It was released 3 years before LOTR was published.

So yes I do agree Martin should be criticized for pushing shock value but so many fans of Tolkien's works often make comments criticizing Rated R content as not just inherently bad and pop culture pulpish but even seem to act like this stuff is all new.

Just go read any of the Eddas that Tolkien loved and well any mythology period because these stuff are not white and black cleancut Disney fairytales. You don't even need strictly high art like Golden Age academy award winning movies and modern Musicals that won Tony. Even stuff thats doing high quality serious level in recent time before Martin's books were made into a TV show were already reaching this level of dark like The Sopranos and HBO's Rome and to put a comic book example, Watchman.

So I honestly think attacking works for fantasy for featuring nudity, rape scenes mass murders, etc is very shortsighted from Tolkien fans considering Homer's Odyssey opens up with Odysseus's crew sacking a town and killing a lot of inhabitants, sparing only women for future ""pleasure"" (implied intention for rape and sexual slavery) and perhaps a few children before being forced o retreat bck to their ships because of an army marching to the sacked community intending to fight them.

I apologise if this has already been discussed.
Someone please refute or agree . 

1) In the  TV series it says that Rhaegar requested for annulment from Elia Martell.  Not divorce.  The books haven't covered this yet. 

2)There is also a line in A clash of kings where Varys is talking to Tyrion and says that apparently Elia cried out someone's name ( most probably someone in King's Landing who could save her ) when Gregor Clegane came with his men to kill her.  

These may not be connected at all 

If we take point 1, then does it mean that Elia and Rhaegar never consummated their marriage the the children are someone else's?

Point 2 could be anyone who was on her side or it could be the name of the person she loved ?",2021-08-03 20:25:12

I just rewatched “The long night” episode and I can’t believe the lack of praise that episode got. Even if I’m wrong I believe that had to be the greatest battle in game of thrones history. The Dragons, the Wights, the entire North with the Dothraki and unsullied⚔️. 

Hell, if anyone paid attention I’m pretty sure they actually BEAT the army of the dead after the first round, it only became hopeless after the knight king resurrected everyone that just got killed 💀.  It was a proper battle of the living versus the dead and after the victory I personally would’ve rode to kings landing and burned that entire sh*t hole down just to get to Cersi. Call me petty but her own goddamn brother fought for the north and was willing to die for the living but not her selfish ass. 

Then there’s the arguments i hear the most. “Why didn’t Jon killed the knight king”? The mf wasn’t there for Jon, you really think the knight king was gonna drop everything he was doing to have a 1v1 against some guy he’s almost killed twice. Jon is my favorite character but cmon. “Why the hell would the women and children go hide in a crypt if they know the knight king can bring back the dead”? Okay, where would you have put them? Everyone knew there was a good chance the dead would storm into winter fell. Arya was literally in the castle hiding from wights that broke in god knows when.

Only dumb part to me is when the Dorthraki rode into the Dead Army like maniacs and got slaughtered but hey, it looked cool for a minute lol. 

I’m sad the last half of season 8 couldn’t live up to the half season finales greatness. The amount of plot holes oh my lord. I’m sure everyone was scratching their head when Danaerys’ army just magically respawned. Other than that, it’s just one mans opinion.",2021-08-03 08:09:38

as someone who cannot stand the fantasy genre ESPECIALLY when it’s in this time period, i think GOT was f******* amazing. the things that made it stand out to me from others is the vast amount of characters, the huge world, the lore, how unpredictable it is and more. there were moments that genuinely made me feel depressed, like the red wedding, or when i thought jon snow had died. just like there were moments that had my heart out of my chest with excitement. but you’ve heard all this im sure, so lets get to the juicy part.

the ending. i know for a fact everyone can agree that the ending was rushed. i haven’t read the books so i don’t know how quickly things happen, but it was rushed. daenerys went from angel to slaughtering thousands in the span of an episode which seriously made no sense to me. it made me lose any connection i had to her. 

i even thought the whole white walker saga was very odd. the whole show the white walkers were hyped up as this huge threat to the realm that we must band together and defeat. only for the final war to be done in an episode.

i seriously don’t understand how arya killed the night king. remember this is the same mf who survived the flames of a fully grown dragon and even fell off of one. only to be stabbed by arya. dont get me wrong i like arya, shes one of my fav characters but come on. the way it ended made me wonder, could the series have just done without white walkers. im ngl i was more interested in who would rule the kingdoms. 

i definitely dont think the ending is anywhere near as people are making it out to be. i can understand if you have following the series since the start, but ive seen people straight up telling ppl who havent watched it not to, because of how bad the ending is. the way i’d put it is this; the ending is not so bad when everyone around u is screaming in ur ear how bad it is.

thats my thoughts. im new to this sub so im curious about other opinions. let me know!

edit: i was just informed that the ending isn’t true to the books, so yes, i also now think the ending is terrible. that is honestly appaling what they did to got man",2021-08-03 07:07:37

I don't want to get into too details of the game that aren't relevant for this post. Troops will move between cities/villages on the map, and it will involve naval movement between cities as well as movement on land. I have some cities that I'm not sure whether or not they should count as ports that are accessible by sea. I don't mean that it is a trade port, but whether that city/village would have been accessible to a naval force for purposes of troop movement. Karhold, Dreadfort, Barrowton, Highgarden, Blackmoat, Hellholt, Honeyhold, Godsgrace, and Vulture's Roost are all along Rivers that come from the sea. Are any of these along rivers big enough for a boat/landing party to traverse that they should be considered accessible? Some cities/villages that are close to the sea, but not right on it are Mistwood, Yronwood, Old Oak, and Crakehall, so I wasn't sure if these should be accessible or not either. Those are the cities I am curious about, please let me know which you think should be accessible by sea.

• yes, he uses Sansa for his own gains in terrible ways, but it also advances her position of power. Def not father of the year 

• Sansa has Tully features. Obviously that’s an important detail since that’s how they figured out about Cersei kids weren’t Baratheons 

• they call her little bird.. LF sigil is a mockingbird

• Catelyn could have been jealous that ned had jon, so she got even. Part of cat liked him from when she was young, so if she was going to cheat after learning about jon, it seems like he would be the one. 

•Jon and Sansa are three years apart, and since Ned comes home after jon is born and  when the war was over, she had to get pregnant within year and half with Sansa. 

• in the books, she is the only one who doesn’t warg into her wolf, which died early but it’s seems too convenient 

•even early on, she wants power and to be a lady unlike the starks personality. After his lessons she is wise and intelligent like LF 

• LF loved Catelyn and is open about that throughout to Sansa. 

•he smuggles her out of kings landing 

•she pretends to be his bastard daughter when she leaves king landing… the irony 

•LF tries to knock out Arya, jon, Ned, and rob, but never her? Odd. Seems like his master plan was to give her what she wanted. 

•he says maybe in a different world you would be my child, what if that just meant he could claim her

• he kills her aunt suspiciously early, which wasn’t in his plan yet, but she threatened Sansa and the last thing he says is I loved your sister 

•he teaches Sansa all these lessons, but why? Her also tries to marry her off , why would he do that if he wanted to eventually marry her 

•he sends the knights of the vale to help her during battle of the bastards to get them to support her 


• when LF met with cat to try to negotiate trading Jamie for Sansa and Arya after ned died, he first tries to says I love you and destiny has given them another chance, then says don’t you want to see both your daughters again, but he knew only Sansa was there not Arya. He arguably even found out Arya was at harrenhal (maybe) and didn’t do anything. 

•going off previous point: it’s possible at that point, he wanted Sansa to get back home (ending the plan for her to marry Joffrey, which she was at this point still, and he meets with Margaery to pose the idea about her marrying Joffrey that day too the day before blackwater, so if the lannisters won, the starks would still March on capital against lannisters and take out tyrells at the same time or if Baratheons won, the tyrell idea would be discarded. LF knew if stannis won, he would eventually go to war with starks for being independent who were already an alliance with tyrells since they would be backing renley still, making the tyrells + renley side of Baratheon allies to starks in that case. That war would end with the north winning, and both Baratheon dying (or stannis would have already taken out renley for wanting his throne first, in which case would still result in tyrells being against stannis.) either way, north would win and LF, who was purposely on everyone’s good side would be the last on the council besides maester and Varys. To cool tensions, cat might marry LF as king and Sansa the heir to throne or the hier to the free north if rob died. Because he obvi didn’t take losing the north as a big problem or knew it was unavoidable since he supported the north and Sansa trumping jon. ( or if it came out Sansa was LF kid and rob died the north would have no stark to support cuz they might have beef with cat and she wouldnt have a true stark or produce any)

Why? What happened to serving the realm?

All he talks about is ""serving the realm"" and the common folk but is that a joke? If that's really your goal Dany sure is an odd choice. He may not have known Dany would turn evil, but she's a conqueror with 3 dragons and an army of rapist Dothraki. Why did he think this would bring peace to Westeros? 

Baelish ends up doing more good than Varys. He saves Sansa twice and kills Joffrey. Varys doesn't do shit but save Tyrion who gives advice so shitty it drove Dany to madness. Killing Tywin is actually what throws the realm (and the show) into shit, Varys should've been supporting him the whole time.

With Maragery as queen and Tywin as the hand that's actually a pretty damn good duo as rulers of the realm. Why tf was he trying to get Dany to rule? And the moment he meets her ""oh I don't like her."" Wtf do you like Varys other than reminiscing on the time you had balls? 

He's pretty useless in the end his spies can't see the golden company, Lannister army, Euron, he can't even see shit flying right at his face. And if Qyburn did effortlessly take over all of his spies why didn't more people do this if it was so simple? You just give candy to a kid and endanger his life?

He promises to tell Dany when she no longer is serving the interests of the common folk and not betray her but all of a sudden he's now team Jon. ""What's that Bran? Your brother is King? Oh well it must be true his best friend told me the same thing."" Then plots to kill her and writes letters on how cool it would be if Jon was king to other lords while Dany is in the next room.

Welcome to round 2 of The Reddit Tourney to determine who is the best fighter from Game of Thrones. (I posted round 1 in ""the other sub"" and now realised why not post it here as well.)

It's simple, characters will be pit in 1v1 contests and you have to vote on who you think would win that fight. Winners progress to the next round.

VOTE HERE: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScK5lNPVV-XnBuo-zWIPlfsusSn8mg_KB8b3STyhY_r2KHb6w/viewform?usp=sf_link

VIEW THE FULL DRAW HERE: https://challonge.com/thereddittourney.svg

A few notes:

The draw is comprised of all the main characters, as per the wikipedia page, plus some others. Sorry if i've missed out anyone else you'd have liked to have seen but i needed to keep it to 64 entrants in order to avoid byes in the draw. Apart from spacing out some of the obviously best fighters the draw has been randomised.

Some characters fighting abilities change a lot over the course of the show (eg J Lannister or Arya) or were more renowned fighters in the lore of the show but it's not shown on screen (Robert Baratheon), in these cases feel free to choose whichever version of that character you like.

They can use whatever weapon, like how in the Mountain vs the Viper they could turn up with whatever weapon they liked, but...

NO MAGIC! It may be worth doing a tourney in the future that includes magic if this one goes well but for now we wont allow magic because it just confuses things.

Ultimately you're just trying to answer the simple question: Who would win in a fight between these two characters?",2021-08-01 19:09:35

Shonklas...

I had to ask my dad what that meant...in fact I'm just now realizing English was clearly not my first language and I have a lot of word fusions in there for words I couldn't think of the English term for, so I would mix up the closest works I can find and smooshing them together...

So another thing to note...Xunolu was never inlove with the original vampire boyfriend and I made it a point that she never said I love you to him, just to her...

With him she used tequiro...with her she use te amo and did the only context she gave him was ""it means I love you"" but I was making it obvious she was lying..

To put into context
Te quiero means (I want you in the literal sense)
So while Native English speakers think it means sexual desire 
It was actually what we said to our family members.. 

So while she finds him sexually attractive, she knows he's trying to use her, so she decides to use him instead. That's why no matter what sexual activity happened between the two...it always amused her that he believed she was obsessed so she thought it was funny to tell him te quiero when they were done

So here is where shonclass come in
Apparently it means both cup and shoe...

So if I was the shoe....

My dad just practically confirmed that Disney stole my idea and everything makes so much sense on why I thought the movies were so weird...

I got to go behind the scenes and see how animations were made, and the Ice queen was already a work in progress but they couldn't figure out how to make it family friendly...then after 911, a lot of the people who worked there did actually talk to me about it when my dad was away but I don't really remember that... so they wanted to put it into a context that a child good understand. A few years later I tried to do it myself since no one my age wanted to talk about these topics

So they did see my work
And I wonder if the reason Elsa is no longer the villain because of me

And the second movie gets better.
My dad is black but I am white...

I couldn't understand why other white kids kept calling me names like albino, Casper, demon girl...

My dad tried to explain that it's because even though I look white, he is my father and he is black, so that makes me gray.. 
Then I said that's why everyone hates me im so ugly...

Then they wrote me a story called you are special
It was a story about puppets and essentially a re imagined version of Pinocchio

It was about a boy puppet in a society where people will give eachother gold stars or Grey dots based on looks or talent. Even though everyone was a puppet and they looked the same ""Pinocchio"" got a Grey dots because his nose grew

When people saw he had so many Grey dots they gave him more Grey dots...

He tried everything he could think of to get those stars, but no matter what, he would fail and get more Grey dots.

Then one day he meets a girl who had no stickers at all!!!

He asked her, why don't you have stickers?

She said 
I KNOW WHO MADE ME SO I DONT NEED THEM ANYMORE

She offered to introduce him, 
To the man who made every puppet in the world 
But he was scared

I HAVE TOO MANY GREY DOTS...
I DONT HAVE ANY STARS 

but she assured him that he didn't care about that at all and would go with him

When he meets the guy who made him he asks
Why did you make me wrong?

He said what makes you think that???

Well just look at me! I'm covered in Grey! I don't have a single gold star...

He says, that's OK, I love you, I'm proud of what I made

Then the puppet says, if you love me, will you give me a star???

He says No, you are special and perfect just the way you are 

But everyone hates me with so many Grey dots

Then he says every time someone gives you a sticker remember this, I made you and I made them...

No one needs stickers to prove how special you are

As he left the stickers started falling off...they tried to replace it with more Grey dots but it never stuck!

Eventually when all the dots were off, people tried giving him gold stars 

But it didn't stick either, but he didn't care

He finally found a place to belong",2021-07-31 03:30:38
[Spoilers] Help me Rewrite Jason Mamoa,0,ourzyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ourzyy/spoilers_help_me_rewrite_jason_mamoa/,2,1627674016.0,"#Warning: I might need to take a shit, where's my battle buddy???

#wounded warriors project 

So apparently Jason Mamoa has a much bigger impact on my sexual awakening as I thought...

He'd be the perfect unnamed vampire that becomes Xunolus boyfriend. I didn't like this guy so I didn't give him much character development.. however 2 big things 

The first book creates a narrative that taught me a very valuable lesson at 10, so while reading the book worried my father, he let it go when I pointed out that ""It's just the Bible but with zombies and dragons"" so he let it go 

However it opened up an incredible dialogue about consent that changed my life.

In the book she is 11 and he is 30. At 10 I didn't see a problem as Mary had Jesus at 14 so it's normal for a character like that.

While I didn't know what sex was, the scene of their wedding night was actually really romantic and taught me consent can happen even if you don't speak the same language you can still consent 

If you don't know the dialogue is exactly the same but it plays out like this...
He removes her clothing notices she is crying and wipes her tears while saying no. When he is done undressing her he distances himself saying no while removing his own clothing. He then removes his jewels and braids...finally he says No?

Then she approaches him, takes his hand, guided it to where she wanted...finally whispering yes 

The other scene with the dragon eggs was romantic too. While they are intimate, she isn't used to riding horses...so she wasn't crying or scared because she didn't want to, she really wanted to she was just really sore. She even starts thinking about how she wishes she could look at him while it was happening, but it's not the dothraki way. However, in this moment she appreciates the dothraki way right now because if he knew she was crying she knew he would stop and she ""wasn't done yet"" so she focuses on the dragon eggs at the same time to make sure he doesn't notice she's crying 

I was so excited for these scenes in because 1...she was already being molested by her brother who she assumed for a long time she would marry. Better to marry the evil she knows than this scary war tribe

2. While now that I'm an adult I understand this change was probably due to the fact that they had such a huge age gap...an 11 year old can not consent to a 30 year old so they probably where trying to tackle that issue, using the language barriers to rationalize it instead.

However, the solution was already there by closing the age gap. Instead, they rob her of the beauty of her wedding night, and the beauty of there sexual relationship and the biblical narrative that women can enjoy sex a lot if its done right 

As a 10 year old who hit puberty at 9. It was a scary time cuz suddenly everything changed and the boys wouldn't leave my boobies alone and I thought it was just another part of the ""eve curse"". I knew what sex was, but it wasn't something for a woman to enjoy, it was her duty to keep her man faithful and have his babies)

To further add to the story.. apparently when I was 5 I basically decided that I was going to part of his ""harem"" when I grew up...

Apparently I thought marriage was just a party you did when you want to be family/roommates cuz it's a sin to live with someone you're not married to so let's just say I had a really long with a clear top 4....

2 were from ""Hawaii baywatch"" a redhead and Jason mamoa. Every time I came home from from a bad day of school there were 3 shows I demanded to see  cuz I needed to see my husband's and wives let's just say, Steve urcle, Mario Lopez, Kokoum, Arielle, Gaston (as the butler) Jason Mamoa and a redhead extra I saw in some sort of baywatch, and another unknown girl from another show. 

Baywatch was particularly frustrating for him cuz I kept saying HAWAII BAYWATCH but he never knew what I meant cuz he never saw the redhead I was looking at and every time he asked where she was I'd say, your too late you already missed her in this episode 

But it was my obvious favorite and I didn't get way he was so confused when I asked for it all the time.

Then it was our ""first trip to Disney"" (he just told me it was an audition and he was kind of hoping I didn't get any part, but also didn't want to Sabatoge my dream if that's what I really did know I wanted for myself).

So when he asked if I was ready to see if I could be a Disney princess, I thought he meant that I was getting married and I was so excited about planning the wedding he couldn't stop me...so I begged him to get me ""All the ring pops"" so I can propose to my favorite characters!!!

Then we would live there and the men...(Gaston and John Smith) would make all the money and do all the cooking and cleaning while I married ""my prince charming"" (Jason Mamoa) and as many princesses I could find to make it ""more fun""

Fast forward to my teen years...and I can't remember the movie but again, he was there but Native American this time so while he was familiar I didn't recognize him...just thought the main characters daughter was really cute...then there's a scene where she meets him at a casino and they flirt every time her dad wasn't paying attention. While I remember the scene, I don't remember any details but my dad said I kept crying I kept doing it till I started crying and when he kept asking me why all I could say was ""I really don't get it but I know God is listening to my thoughts as I'm trying to figure it out...I'm pretty sure no matter what I do I'm going to hell.

Now that I'm an adult I see that 
1. He married a woman I can recognize and was on my list of potential princess candidates...

2. Now that I know it wasn't 3 guys but 1 Jason Mamoa 

3. He marries Daenerys in the show 

4. Now that I'm all grown up, he still causes me so much confusion. I don't know if I want to be him, try to purchase ""a big penis"" so I can fight him for the women in his life, or if I want to actually sleep with him myself

5. To make matters worse...I just had a thought and during the research I was doing I came across an interview about a ""fuzzy pink sock"" so now the idea of either fighting him or sleeping with him makes me want to pee my pants....

6. All I can say is if I were to ""get a big penis to compete with"" it would have to get an impossibly large one to compete...the nature of this concept makes me think of Cthulu...so yeah, my penis is Cthulu and it's bigger then Jason Mamoas and I get to keep my cool boobs...

So now I'm thinking of a story like this 
Xunolu is Vampire boys first wife (based on Jason Mamoas current irl wife)
Chrystalynn was originally a surface elf so while it was an attempt to save her life, the dark nature of vampire powers corrupted her natural life energy causing her to have an existential crisis that drove her to madness...she became terrorist #1because reality became distorted and enhanced her PTSD so she went into survival mode...

Since another issue I grew up with was being called Casper, albino, since I'm white but my dad is mixed but looks very black...we even got a DNA test to prove he actually was my father because I was positive I was either adopted or switched at birth because being in a multicultural household, where my brothers and I were the only white people there...so it's only natural for me to be the terrorist #2/kahleesi

So basically, Xunolu, Vampire are together and meet Kahleesi saving her life because she was the last human as there is a race war, but humans wiped themselves out because they were too busy waring over what human should have the iron thrown to know that terrorists were planning to make their move to overthrow humanity. Despite being saved, being human meant that she was immune to gaining any powers. Knowing that they decide to protect her, eventually forming a power throuple, which greatly extended her life...every time she ""dies"" they bite her to bring her back 

They decided to work together to win the Iron throne, making Xunolu head queen because she already naturally had dark magic that she had under control by being drow, but being also a vampire amplifies her dark magic so she is the most powerful of the 3

However, once in power it became clear they had very different versions of what paradise means 

Xunolu wants a strict military society (qunari/dragon age)

Vampire as an issue as it removes all forms of freedom including freedom of thought. He thought the solution was easy, turn everyone in the world into vampires and people would stop fighting...

Kahleesi argues it isn't that simple, as people would rather be free in chaos that prescribe to conformity in paradise....

But at the end of the day Xunolu was head queen and it was her decision. At first it was paradise. Everything was simple, no one had to think for themselves or worry about comfort and security 

But 1000 years later, terrorism happens because the people wanted ""give me liberty or give me death""

Vampire goes, that's my cue, death....
So he starts converting everyone thinking  the experience he had with crystalyn was just a rare fluke...but forcing creatures with natural light magic into vampires with dark magic caused insanity death and another long war...this time the vampires are all wiped out through genocide...

Kahleesi decides she just wants to die now, but for the first time...nothing works. Later realizes there's powerful magic in love and blood and she is possibly immortal 

She becomes ""Bran"" through her own strength but immediately burns the throne and introduces democracy before running away.  

Then she lives a quiet life as a bard, eventually creating the ""bards alliance/friends of Red Jenny""

As this alliance focuses on using The expressive arts  as a form of therapy and coping with all the war around us...

But as we got more and more famous as bards and an alliance , mental health issues were being tackled and while she ran as far as she could from her original country...

Her ideas changed the culture and diplomacy of the already diplomatic country she resides in ""Hawaii""

Then Hawaii takes over the world...not through power or strength, but through the Aloha Spirit. Finally lasting peace is obtained and she visits the grave, saying she never thought she would ever return. She is incredibly old at this point almost like a skeleton..no one even remembers who she is anymore but her stories and songs were taught to the current generation in school and she becomes a history professor in a small local town.

She tries one more time to kill herself, but it just ends up with her becoming young again...she laughs as she says, ""well I guess I somehow got stuck in the heaven you made for me, or maybe I am already dead...either way, I spend my time making sure people remember you for who you both really were...

And that's the end
Goodbye 

So now here is a song dedicated to all creators and entertainment...if you see this and have any ideas or pointers, especially with transitions because ""and suddenly we are fighting people in outerspace wouldn't work...

P.s. shout out to Rick and Morty for Jessica because now she is a time God and I'd be totally cool with them using my ideas for her arch...just be sure to #warning: I may need to take a shit soon, where's my battle buddy if you guys decide to use my ideas...maybe she could even become Rick's new nemesis in a weird way...or...if the theory that Rick and Morty are the same, maybe she really is alluding to the fact that she just saw the future and knows she's his grandma now...it would be fun to see them try to make that work

But here's the song...ps, Dan Harmon, since Harmonquest exists, I'd love if we could play d&d to improve the work of season 8 D&D....

So again... a song dedicated to fellow artists

Show me show me show me how you do that trick 

The one that makes me scream she said

The one that makes me laugh she said 

And threw her arms around my head

Show me how you do it!

And I promise you I promise you 

I'll run away with you 

I'll run away with you

Spinning on that Dizzy edge 
I kissed her face 
I kissed her head
And dreamed of all the different ways I had to make her glow

Why are you so far away she said

How could you ever know 

That I'm inlove with you

I'm in love with you

You one and only 
You lost and lonely 
Resisting in the waters 

Your just like dream!
Your just like a dream!

Daylight licks me into shape 
I must have been asleep for days
In moving lips I breathe your name
And open up my eyes

I found myself alone alone alone above a raging sea
Who stole the only one I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You one and only 
You just like heaven

Murmaider Murmaider Murmaider 
Go into the water
Live there 
Die there 

We reject your land empires
Lungs transform to take in water
On on on we swim through our dreams 

Swim and swim and swim on
We swim home

Let's ride

Go into the water 
Live there die there!
It's home!
#the art of drowning

Finally the hills are without eyes 
They were tired of watching a dead man's face
Red with their own blood..

They used to love
Having so much to lose
Close your just once and see everything in ruin

What's left to be alive???

Did you ever read what I wrote you?
Did you ever hear what I told you?
Did you ever listen to a word we played 
Or did you just let the wrong things in

Did we get this high just feel your pain?
Did we play just to be pawns in your game?
How blind could you be don't you see 
You took the wrong road 
But we're here waiting 
Bye bye beautiful!

How blind can you be don't you see
How blind can you be don't you see

Did we get this high just to feel your pain?
Did we play just to be pawns in your game 
How blind can you be don't you see 
You took the wrong road but we'll be waiting 
Bye bye beautiful 
Bye by beautiful!

This beautiful tragedy
Is crashing into me
This dying destiny 
Take me away

Will you be there for me? Or will you be
The death of me 
Oh my Beautiful tragedy 

Silent nights 
Let me sleep away the memories within
Sacrifices of purity is turning me to sin
And this judgement day is growing near
And this confession
Is killing me again 

This beautiful tragedy 
Is crashing into me
This dying destiny 
Take me away....

My girl she's a column
In the million pages written 
Since the universe existed 
And every little piece of mind

She provides 
Just the strength I need 
Let's me breathe 
Let's me breath
Cuz 

I'm in love with a ghost 
Why don't you haunt me in my dreams 
Please possess me while I sleep so I could lock you up inside my head and never let you leave me here with my heart in my hands I'm here with my heart in my hands now 

Cuz yes your the star beneath the stairs 
Yes your my ghost upon the stage 
You are my everything 

Endless night
Tears are falling down 
But I'm still holding on
Finding strength I never knew
ILL WATCH YOU
AND TRY TO BE Like you!

You are my guiding star!


Dedicated to anyone else working on fan fiction 
Medicate
You and me
Now as we 
Lose ourselves in this and ignore 
That you don't even know my name!

Can you
Feel this?

Does it sting?

I FEEL NOTHING AT ALL
CAN WE PRETEND THIS IS REAL
I FEEL NOTHING AT ALL!
CAN WE MAKE IT DISAPPEAR?
I FEEL NOTHING

He permanently strains his marriage and allows himself to be viewed as an adulterer by concealing Jon’s identity to save him from Robert


He strains his friendship with and risks the wrath of the King by objecting to Dany’s murder


He risks his life and gives up the power of surprise by telling Cersei what he knows to save her children 


He sacrifices the last of his honor and allows his legacy to be that of a traitor by bending the knee to Joffrey and giving a false confession in front of all of KL to protect Sansa. 


Thinking of this got me comparing him to other characters and as I went along I realized that a large majority of them were guilty of killing, ordering to be killed or being complicit in the killing of a child.  Here the list of those I can remember:

Jamie

Cersei

Tywin

Joffrey 

The Mountain

The Hound

Peter

Stannis

Melisandre

Theon

Dagmer 

Robert

Jorah

Varys

Pycelle

Renly 

Ellaria / sand snakes

Ramsey

Walder + sons

Roose 

Dany

Janos

Lysa

Mirri Maz Dur

Khal Drogo 

Hoster 

Jeor

Olenna

Craster

Rickard  Karstark

Bron (said he would depending on $$)

Poliver

The tickler

Cat 

Aerys

Masters of Meereen 

Night king/ walkers

The waif 

Joaquin

Some would say Jon for Ollie

Ser Amory

Kraznys 

All of the unsullied who regrettably will remain individually unnamed 

and of course these two would have killed a child I’m sure but were technically only child beaters and rapists:

How they compare Tyrion’s and Theon’s character journeys are perfect examples of this. When the two meet Tyrion is a man who knows who he is. He might hate Cersei, Joffrey, and Tywin. But he’s a member of the family and goes to incredible lengths for his family. He has no other family or loyalty. This only changes as the former three plot against him. Theon on the other hand has two families, he struggles with his loyalty, has an identity crisis between being Stark and Ironborn, and does horrible things as a result later on. This (and an insane amount of abuse) also contributes to his transformation into Reek and furthers his identity crisis as he believes that it’s too late change and that he deserves whats happened to him. 

Throughout the story, we see these two characters slowly change positions  mentally until it comes to a head with the completion of their arcs in S8. Theon’s story ends with him, his sister, and the Starks having accepted that he is both Ironborn and Stark. He dies fighting to save them both. Meanwhile at the same time, Tyrion is struggling with his loyalty to his Queen, his family, and friends who are quickly losing faith in Dany. He’s no longer sure of his loyalty and is conflicted. 

I’ve always been big on credit where it’s due. To me, this was a pretty cool callback and comparison.",2021-07-30 09:35:48

I’ve been on the fence about whether I want to watch Game of Thrones for a long time. But I absolutely can’t get into a series if I have had major details, plot points, or twists spoiled.A few years ago a friend accidentally spoiled a major death for me but another friend recently told me I should still be able to watch it, based on another detail I’d learned. Last night I watched the episode of South Park titled “Black Friday” and I’d realised it was heavily referencing Game of Thrones. I was okay with minor details being spilled and it was making Game of Thrones seem really interesting. But by the end of the episode I’d seen some references to some really big plot points. I haven’t watched the second South Park Game of Thrones episode yet though. Given what South Park referenced I’m sure I’ll be able to figure out which Game of Thrones characters were being parodied in South Park. So without giving further information on what South Park “spoiled” for me, can someone please tell me if they think I could still possibly get into the show?

Upon rewatching for the umpteenth time, I had a revelation during S6 EP10 ""The Winds of Winter."" **What if the Lord of Light (LoL) is simply GRRM?**

If this extremely meta guess is true, it makes many lines like *(paraphrased)* ""The Lord of Light brought you back because you still have a purpose to serve,"" make sense. **GRRM is the characters' ""Creator"" or ""God.""** He is writing their plots and thus brings Jon back from the dead to serve his ultimate purpose at the end of S8 (killing Dany). Melisandre says she doesn't have the power to bring men back, it was given to her by the Lord of Light. GRRM as LoL fits since quite literally the Red Woman doesn't have the power until GRRM wills these powers into being via his writing. Their 'roles to play' are plot points later established by GRRM.

All in all, reminds me of the movie ""Stranger than Fiction"" (STF) with Will Ferrel and Emma Thompson. If you've seen STF, the correlation works out to Will = Bran and Emma = GRRM. (Bran being aware of the LoL is not established in the show but I \[hope\] think that maybe the books will shed more light on where Bran is going during S8 visions.) Obviously this is all just me taking shots in the dark but the more I think about it, the more it makes sense. What do you think?",2021-07-30 00:18:14

[Spoilers] question about season 7 episode 6,4,otrjbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/otrjbc/spoilers_question_about_season_7_episode_6/,6,1627537756.0,"This is my first time through the show, so please don’t spoil anything that is upcoming. 


So earlier on in the series, when bran asks uncle Benji to come with them across the wall and to winterfell, his uncle tells him of spells in place to keep the dead outside the wall, and since he had been partially turned, he was prevented from crossing. Then, in season 7 ep 6, when they all fly on the dragon across the wall, they brought the hostage zombie with them. I thought the spells kept the zombies from being able to cross the wall, at least to my knowledge at this point in the series. IF something about this is mentioned later on in the series, just tell me, but don’t tell me what it is. My only thought was that the spell didn’t apply if you fly over the wall, only for those attempting to go through the tunnel, but that seems lame. It would do nothing to prevent the undead from climbing over. Either that or this is a continuity error in the show.

Like I said, please don’t spoil anything that is upcoming.",2021-07-29 11:19:16
[SPOILERS] Ending refurbished. (Last 1),3,otq8qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/otq8qw/spoilers_ending_refurbished_last_1/,13,1627532099.0,"I'll try not to alter too much what happened prior to season 7. Instead of happening in season 8 the battle for winterfell would happen at the very end of season 7. This not a total play by play, I do not go into a whole lot of detail and this is just how I would've taken the story. You'll notice I do not write much on Tyrion, Varys, or Bealish but it's not because they don't do anything but because I'm only focusing on the biggest set pieces. 

#Changes

The NK - I would change the night king entirely. Instead of making him a full blown villain with the end goal of touching a little boy(Bran), he actually is avenging the genocide of the children of the forest and is doing everything to save the few left. This is a major change and makes the NK not so black and white and gives him actual motivation. I would take out his gloating antics and instead replace them with logical ones. He's no sword fighter, so in this scenario he never goes on the front line or dare engages in combat but instead he's more of a sorcerer. Another change I would make to the NK is by not making his resurrection of the dead as simple as waving his arms. Necromancy is 1 of the most difficult abilities 1 can conjure it would make no sense for him to do it instantly with ease. Also expand his abilities beyond necromancy, dwelling deeper into this by giving him more scenes and not just being a one-note villain popping up everytime there's action.

#Omission

Mad queen, Dothraki, Golden Company, and Euron - with only 13 episodes left I feel it is not possible to implement any of these plots properly.

#Season 7

The NK gets past the wall not with a dragon but by freezing the river the Shadow Tower overlooks (kinda like in Harry Potter with the dementors. This is no small thing tho as such a feat takes days or weeks.) With the assault of the castle Arya, Theon, and Sansa are entirely absent and the ones left to defend it are Bran, Jon, Davos, Ed, Sam, Melisandre, Tormund, and a few other northern lords. 

Instead of Arya teleporting to the twins she instead teleports to riverrun. Jaime never takes this castle and the blackfish still holds it. Arya's team up and support with the blackfish would create a nice duo as both have been seeking justice for their family for years. Also change her cringey monotonous acting. 

Sansa goes to the Eyrie with Brienne and Pod to convince Robin to send the entirety of the Vale's forces to aid in the long night. 

Bran does manage to get south of wall and is back in winterfell which Jon has commandeered. Upon his return Jon offers up the north to Bran but Bran refuses. Bran has spent so much time in the minds of animals he begins having feral proclivities. Bran is actually scared of himself and what he is and knows Jon is the better leader they need. Bran isn't omnipotent in this version, he has frequent nightmares, hallucinations, and muscle spasms. With the 3ER having died prematurely Bran has not properly been taught how to control his power and he's just a kid. I would take out his time traveling ability and only make it so he wargs and has bits of foresight but usually comes in the form of night terrors.

The NK slaughters everyone who couldn't get south of winterfell in time before descending onto winterfell itself. A few days (or weeks idk) prior to the assault Jon would have sent a raven to all the high lords of westeros requesting aid. 

Theon gets word of Jon's call for aid but is unable to answer it in time. He attempts to convince his father yet again to aid the Starks. Big difference being Yara supports Theon's request this time. Balon's refusal to aid and instead attack and massacre of a northern lord's castle would start a Civil War against his children. Yara and Theon would be forced to face their own father in open war. Yara would ultimately be forced to kill her father as she views him as too self destructive and a danger to their own people. This would fulfill Theon's original objective which was to bring aid to the Starks. Also giving more development to both Yara and Theon. (Similar to Euron's civil war but instead of introducing a new character this late into the show we villianize a character the audience is already familiar with. Also by taking out interference from other main characters you don't end up side lining Theon or Yara like in the show.)

While the Starks have been dealing with the dead, Jaime, Uncle Kevan, and a few other lords of the westerlands would have been dealing with the rebellion led by the blackfish, olenna, and Dorne. Having slaughtered house Tyrell (I'd keep Olenna's death roughly the same) they head south to deal with the Sand Snakes seeing them as a bigger force than the small resistance in the riverlands. He leaves walder to occupy the riverlands but instructs him not to kill the blackfish or do anything rash until his return as he does not want to destroy what little is left of the Tully family. Jaime after hearing of Jon's call for aid would call off his assault of Sunspear and answer it against Cersei's order. He would take roughly 12,000 soldiers and march to aid the family he regretfully decimated years ago. 

During the siege of winterfell Tormund would sacrifice himself for Jon and can only make out the final words ""my daughters"" before dying in Jon's arms(attempting to tell Jon to save his daughters who in this scenario have already been introduced and established.) When Jaime gets there the castle is already under siege and close to falling.(Not going into great detail) Jaimie would charge the dead giving those left time to escape the castle, by this time Davos and Ed have already died defending the wall. Jaime and the Lannister cavalry would meet their death on the field at this battle with only Bran, Jon, Melisandre and a few others (mostly northern and wildling women and children)making it further south. Jaime would lead a final charge head on towards countless wights to give the others time to make it south. The closest thing I could imagine it to would be the battle for Minas Tirith except everybody dies and those that don't run away. 

After Robin refuses to send his men outside of the kingdom Sansa meets up with Jon and Bran either in Moat Cailin or white harbor. 

In this story Dany's arrival is pushed back significantly. Dany would have given up on her dreams of conquering westeros and would have stayed in essos where she feels she is still needed. She puts the citizens needs before her wants. (This would have been a scene with her speaking to Jorah while overlooking the civilians of Mereen prospering in the world she has built for them.) Only upon hearing of the defeat of the lannister force, the destruction of the Stark stronghold, and the mass genocide in the north by a necromancer would Dany then begin her sail to westeros. Not to conquer but to save.

#Beginning of Season 8

With the loss of winterfell Jon decides the best place to hold them is at the twins. With the bridge being the only way to cross you force them in a bottleneck. 

In this scenario Arya hasn't killed Walder. Jon meets up and gathers with Arya, Blackfish (the siege of riverrun having been lifted as Walder pulls back and fortifies the twins), Sansa, Bran, Beric, Thoros, Yara, Theon, and the Hound.

Thoros, Beric, and the Hound have been protecting the small folk from Walder's rule. (Instead of suddenly running north like in the show with no buildup)

The NK continues his onslaught of what's left in the north while the northeners that did choose to go south faces the twins. 

The taking of the twins isn't something glossed over with teleporting Arya. While Arya will be the 1 to kill Walder it's spread out over 2 episodes and involves her saving Edmure. It'll be some Assassin's creed shit. Also would have more scenes with Walder building him up to make his demise all the more impactful. 

The following episodes will mostly focus on Dany sailing and Arya's infiltration of the twins. Before killing Walder, in 1 of his rooms she will find the rotting body of her brother. This will be a really emotional scene and will provoke a very vindictive Arya. (Little tangent I do think in the books Walder is holding his body I'll bet money on it.) Also Bran uses his warging into rats to help her along her reconnaissance. 

With the fall of Walder Arya threatens to kill his wife if she doesn't open the gates and swear fealty. With the surrender of the remaining Freys the Starks and greyjoys now occupy the twins. Instead of genociding the remaining Freys they ally with them aware that they can't do this alone.

Robin would eventually come to the aid of his cousins. In this scenario Baelish and Robin would have gotten many more scenes strengthing their bond or shall I say manipulation he has over the boy. I would also give scenes to Robin and Royce and show the impact and the positive influence Royce has on him and how he convinces him to fight besides his family. 

With the Twins now fortified with Greyjoys, Starks, Tully's, Arryn, and Frey the NK descends upon them once he finishes everyone north.

While the battle would start heavily in Jon's favor the Neverending wave of dead would begin to overwhelm him. With nobody being familiar fighting giant spiders, bears, giants, and mammoths the battle starts dipping into the NK's favor. Yara, Robin, the blackfish, and Sam would die here. Yara fighting by Theon's side, the blackfish Arya's, and Robin protecting Sansa. In his final moments Robin would apologize for abandoning her earlier and she would think of how this is her 5th relative to die fighting for her. 

With The blackfish and Arya having spent time together his death would greatly affect her and having him dying protecting her would probably be the best choice. In his final time he would attempt to consulate Arya by telling her ""I never wanted to die in a shit place like this."" (Or he could die telling her she reminds him of her mother or something.)

As the dead start coming over the wall Dany's forces would sweep in. While there is joyous, confusion and relief with Dany's arrival she's suddenly hit with a bolt of lightning killing her instantly. Ok now hear me out. It obviously wouldn't be immediate she'd wreck some shit but she would inevitably fall. 

(Like that scene from LOTR where Saruman conjures lighting with a spell to dissuade the fellowship from going over the mountains and forcing then under it.) It would be similar to that. The NK is not on the front line it makes no sense for him to be. He watches the battle from afar and shows great annoyance with Dany's arrival. (And chucking spears like Tom Brady is just stupid.)

As Dany kills thousands of dead she notices clouds getting darker and thunder in the distance. She's suddenly hit and both her and drogon fall to their death. (This is 1 time I thing slow motion could work perhaps with Jorah watching her fall and attempting to find her body before being restrained.)

With her untimely death the NK retreats his forces. Again in this scenario resurrecting the dead isn't as simple as it's made to be in the show, it actually takes time and effort. The NK is unsure and hesitant to reawaken a dragon as he has never attempted to resurrect a magical beast and is unsure if he could even control it. 

With the death of Dany and destruction of the twins they make the bold choice to make their way to Kings Landing with Dany's allies knowing they can no longer hold this position. 

Upon their mother and brother's death both Raegal and Viserys fly away and take residence in Harrenhall. Why Harrenhall? Idk cuz it's been destroyed by dragon fire, is massive, and abandoned. That shit would be bad ass two giant ass dragons in the ruins of a once great castle destroyed by dragon fire. And got 1 season left ain't got time to go to Volantis and they've never even been so they wouldn't even know what direction to go in or know that that's where dragons originally came from. Instead they fly to an abandoned castle not wanting to harm any of the natives. This would show both their empathy, intelligence, and natural animal instincts.

Edit  - Having a scene of Kinvara trying to talk Dany out of going to westeros would be a good scene.

#End of Season 8

Having lost the twins our heroes head further south. Towards King's Landing. 2 alternate ideas are suggested.

1 is retreating to the Vale and holding the NK at the bloody gate. This is however decided against as Jon knows the bloody gate and Vale are completely defenseless against an attack from the air. 

Sansa argues taking Casterly Rock and making their final fight there. But as Jon no longer wants to seek retribution for his family but instead wants to save those he has left he chooses not to attack. He knows the largest portion of the lannister army is at king's landing which would give him the best chance at defeating the dead. Not only that but if Jon's worst fear is right the only way to stop drogon would be a scorpion.

As they make their way to KL it is said they can't beat the dead without the aid of the other 2 dragons. Varys mentions they're in Harrenhall but without their mother nobody has any hope in controlling them. Jon would make his leave at night telling only Arya his mission. To attempt to tame these beasts. In this story nobody knows Jon is a Targareyen. Neither Bran or Sam found out so not even Jon knows. This is a huge risk but Jon sees this as his only hope.

The following episodes would be Jon entering Harrenhall and coming across and taming these beasts. This wouldn't be glossed over as it is in the show this would require time. This could also be the revelation that Jon is a Targareyen but I think having the audience know it and not the characters is a better route. (Not like they do anything with the information anyways.) 

While Jon tames Raegal and Viscerys it mirrors scenes of The NK taming drogon. This is not an easy feat for the NK however as a mind as powerful as a dragon(even a dead 1) is actually strenuous. This would at least be 2 episodes. 

You would have the arrival of our heroes at the gates of king's landing. Cersei would have shut the gates and manned the walls preparing for war. War is not however what our heroes are seeking, only survival. They knew well enough they wouldn't be welcomed in right away and remain far enough away from their archers. Only Tyrion walks up to the gate and is accepted in. Cersei already knows he didn't kill Joffrey but with him having killed her father she still holds hatred for him. This would be a different cersei than what we saw in season 8 as Jaime is gone. Tyrion is the last person in her family and she's not as ready to kill him as she once was. She's alone and scared of whatever killed Jaime but still does not let the rest of our heroes in. She only agrees to protect Tyrion but all the others have been left out. 

With a distant roar our heroes think it to be Jon but instead it's the NK. In this scenario you give the writers what they want by placing an army outside of the castle gates(which is a stupid thing to do when defending but here they have no choice.) As drogon flies closer and closer all of our heroes hug the walls with the unsullied holding them in. Drogon passes above them and instead assaults the wall and the scorpions shooting at him. Bronn would actually be 1 of the 1st to die. With Bronn's death the men defending the wall would panic and disobey Cersei's orders allowing our heroes inside. It is too late however. As the unsullied hold off the dead with a massive shield wall there is no way for them to retreat. 

(Not going into great detail.)

Qyburn would take the Mountain and abandon Cersei. This scene would end with Qyburn getting on a small boat with the mountain (showing Cersei where his true loyalties lie) and sailing east while Cersei cries as she is alone. Tyrion would come to her side and attempt to save her from the wrath of Drogon. Tyrion and Cersei would be in the red keep running thru the halls as they collapse around them. After killing his father he shows great regret and both of them refuse to let their last family member die. As then they would be truly alone. I would keep Cersei's death the exact same with 1 change. Tyrion. She holds Tyrion the way she does Jaime in the show and the red keep completely collapses on them. (Not just a few bricks.) Dead Drogon with the NK on it's back would not do a drive by of the red keep no he would obliterate it and all of it's inhabitants. 

Sansa with Bran now inside King's Landing finds a safe place to lay him down. Bran is shaking and sweating excessively because the great toll the warging and foresight has taken upon him. 

The hound has now taken control of the defense of king's landing and coordinates with some lannister men to incapacitate drogon. 

Greyworm with Jorah, Beric, Thoros, Theon still hold the shield wall. As the lannister men upon the walls rain arrows down from above. 

As just then Jon then comes onto the battle with Raegal and Viscerys. Jon lands on the battlefield as the dragons attempt to kill their brother knocking the NK off and falling several hundred feet.

Drogon being far bigger, faster, and stronger overwhelms both Dragons. As both Raegal and Viserys are too maimed to continue fighting anymore Drogon would make his way to Jon. 

Bran having seen Jon meet his death upon dragon fire in his dreams knows what's to come. Bran makes the decision to warg into Drogon. (This is not only an animal Bran has never encountered but also a magical dead 1. The exertion would be great and not something he can do for too long.) Bran forces drogon onto the NK's own men. As he destroys more and more dead Sansa begins seeing blood coming from his nose and foam from his mouth. She begs Bran to come back and to get out of Drogon but Bran knows what he must do and flies towards the NK. His shaking gets worse and he begins having muscle spasms. Bran begins panicking unsure of what's going on or what to do. Bran dies before making it to the NK. In a last ditch effort he attempts to escape into any animal around him(or perhaps he's trying to come back into his own body.) A cat, rat, bird, dog, Nymeria but to no avail. He dies in Sansa's arm shaking uncontrollably (similar to how jojen was) as Sansa begs him not leave her alone here, as both father and Arya did many years ago.

Jon along with Beric are on the battlefield and have made their way towards where the NK has fallen but Jon takes a spear in the leg and Beric is cut down before him. Theon runs to his side and Jon tells him to retreat into the walls. Theon refuses to leave the man he calls brother and claims they can do this together. He protects Jon but ultimately would die before Jon's eyes.

Greyworm being the only main character left still fighting on the field makes the (ill advised but admirable) decision to disband the shield wall and to commit to the offensive attempting to fight his way to Jorah and save him. Having failed to save 2 of his rescuers (Dany and Barristan) he will not fail again. Bodies stack high around him but he refuses to fall back.

Drogon would be making his way towards Jon but is shot by the hound and stumbles into some buildings. Rather than flee, the hound and a few lannister men load another bolt into the scorpion. Drogon now fixes his sights on the hound. The hound waits until drogon is closer for a better shot and maybe even perhaps blind the beast. Both the bolt and the Hound are swallowed up in flames. He dies screaming along with the men around him. While he died he did not fail, as the hound knew he was never going to kill the beast but rather give everyone else more time.

On the field Jon is brought to his knees unable to stand, sword in hand. The NK just out of reach. The NK raises the dead around Jon and he comes face to face with Theon. Unable to bring himself to strike his brother down he mutters a prayer the same 1 Ned did before Ilyn Payne killed him. Before Theon brings the blade down onto Jon, the NK is stabbed in the back by Beric. Beric stands once more, not as a wight but as a man. A man blessed by the lord of light 1 final time. As the NK dies so does all of his followers. 

Jon grabs Theon's lifeless body before it can fall to the floor, gently lying him down. Jon holds his brother and passes out from blood loss on top of him.

Beric having killed the NK collapses with Thoros running to his side. Beric makes something out only Thoros can hear. Something along the lines of ""the nightmares, the voices, the mission, it's all over."" Beric dies in Thoro's arm. Rather than attempt to revive his friend and put him thru anymore suffering he finally let's Beric rest in peace. As his watch has ended.

#Fast forward to the end

I would ultimately have Jon rule the north. Even if he does find out he's a Targareyen it matters not as he truly doesn't ""wunt et."" The 2 dragons however would go to dragon stone where they would live. 

I would have Sansa and Gendry rule westeros. As a call back to where it all started. Sansa going off to wed Robert's son. She's finally finished what she started.

Arya goes to travel Essos with Thoros. (Not going west of westeros like some Dora explorer bullshit.)

Baelish would rule the Eyrie as Robin left him charge and house Arryn is now extinct.

Oberyn's daughters would rule Dorne, Edmure Riverrun, and Kevan Lannister the westerlands. 

Give Tormund's daughters (who we would have spent time with) the dreadfort and not have the wildlings go north of the wall. 

North of the wall would from here on belong to the children of the forest. While the NK died he did save those he loved. Again taking out him being a full blown villain. Being driven to the monster he became because what man did to him.

Edit - Also Sansa and Gendry would order the death of Lyanna Mormont for being a stuck up little bitch all the time.",2021-07-29 09:44:59

I have watched the show sporadically, though I did experience the whole mess season 8 was, but I have read all five of the books and there are two things I'm really wondering about.

The first one is about Catelyn. I disliked her on the show but for some reason I really liked her in the books. I mean maybe some of it was because I had sympathy for her knowing that the red wedding is coming (spoiled before reading check) but I felt respect for her in a way. I mean she was really intelligent, at least compared to Robb who, at least at the books, seemed so annoying to me. He was really arrogant, thankfully not in Joffrey way, but Catelyn was way smarter and seemed to know better about politics and stuff but NOONE would listen to her. So yeah, I just see that she gets a lot of hate while Robb doesn't as much and I think the opposite would make more sense.

Now about Cersei, I find her to be very interesting even though she is nuts and insane, probably BECAUSE she is all that and I think that she get more credit for being an idiot than she deserves about all the decisions she makes when she gets a POV and because of her arrogance, but at the point she gets a POV she is already so messed up with all that has happened. At least through other POVS in the first books she seemed smarter. I just think that her arrogance and obsessions blind her (don't get me wrong, I hate her as much as everyone else) but that's not what I wanted to say at all. I'm just really wondering what do you think is gonna happen with her in the next book (if it ever gets published). It seems like there's a plan for her, but I really don't understand what. I don't think they'll follow the show on this.

[SPOILERS] Did you like Jaime's conclusion?,1,osqbvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/osqbvj/spoilers_did_you_like_jaimes_conclusion/,21,1627403739.0,"I'm just curious because I see a lot of people hating on it because it undermines what a great guy Jaime was but I think it's 1 of the few things (maybe the only thing) season 8 does right. 

I don't like his thicc ass plot armor (or that he survived the long night) but I don't think Jaime was this great guy everyone sees. This is the same man who raped his sister next to her son's corpse and threatened to catapult Edmure's baby at a stone wall. 

Yes he saved half a million people at king's landing but why? Was it just for them? Not for his father? Himself? The fact he constantly says he'll do anything to see Cersei again? 

Had Tywin ordered the death of everyone at king's landing would he have stopped him? Would he oppose his own family to save civilians? He didn't do anything when the Targaryen children were being murdered. Because it didn't harm him or his family in any way. Cersei blows up the Sept and he still stays by her side. 

A bad character can do good things. Example both Stannis and Baelish have done good things but they're far from being good people. The books might head in a different direction but as far as the show goes I don't think this out of character for Jaime to go back. They showed us time and time again he is a selfish person. Giving Brienne armor to repay a debt is a nice thing but again Baelish saving Sansa was a nice thing. Him being nice to your favorite character (Tyrion and Brienne) doesn't make him a nice person. 1 is family the other is a friend. But what about civilians? He's never showed cared for them. 

But feel free to disagree and if there are any spelling errors my bad.

Edit - Also him killing Cersei would've done absolutely nothing as Dany mawn lowers the city anyways and only does a drive by at the red keep. So him killing her would've essentially just been for the sake of him killing her and not the saving of anybody.

[SPOILERS] My issue with the ending.,4,osi9cq,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/osi9cq/spoilers_my_issue_with_the_ending/,76,1627371538.0,"It got contradictory and stupid near the end.

For eg. Ser barriston, who used to win against great warriors, died by the hands of street thugs. I get he was old but he was definitely shown as very capable in previous seasons and then he died so easily in a street fight.

Tyrion whose only weapon was his wits took so many stupid decisions, i get even the smartest people can take wrong decisions but it feels like he didn't just take wrong decisions, he became kinda supid than the previous season version of him which feels contradictory to me, they build him as smart then make him take stupid actions.

Spider died so awkwardly, i know its game of thrones and people die unexpectedly. But previous deaths like this made the show more intriguing (like red wedding, it was very unexpected but it didn't put me off, it just made me more engaged) but spider's death really felt like forced, it felt more like a production decision, (they didn't know what to do with the character so they killed him) than a plot point.

Dany becoming what she hated. I don't mind that dany became evil and killed thousands of innocents as much as i mind the speed of her transition, if they had taken it slowly and gradually made her evil, it would be totally acceptable but she became a devil from an angel in like 2-3 eps, and for no justifiable reason. In short i don't mind her becoming evil, it again felt like a production decision not a plot point and i hate that.

And many more like bran becoming the king(didn't he say he can't inherit anything?) John going back to wall(he is the actual heir!), Cercie was smarter than that! And so many more.

Tldr:
S7's and especially s8's plots felt like production decisions and not storyline. They rushed everything, if they had given us the exact same ending but in a span of 4-5 seasons taking it slowly and giving enough reasons for transitions of characters, i would have most probably liked it, just think about the transition of hound, from a loyal servant to rouge, no one minded that because it made sense as they gradually transitioned him, imagine if that had happened in a single ep, no one would like that as it would felt unrealistic. 

In super short: they rushed it.

"[SPOILERS] Just rewatched the whole series again, including Season 8…",62,os7ges,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/os7ges/spoilers_just_rewatched_the_whole_series_again/,98,1627331732.0,"I’m ready for the downvotes. Here we go.

I fucking loved Season 8. No joke.

When I first saw it, I was kind of mixed, but definitely more positive about it than other people. Rewatching it made me appreciate it even more. I think what helped was already knowing how it would end and not thinking of all the theories that could happen.

Daenerys’ fall was very believable to me. People don’t really realize this, but she wasn’t afraid to spill blood during her time in Essos, even those who aren’t completely evil. But with the love of all the people there, her worst impulses were checked. Seeing her come to Westeros, losing more than winning, seeing the people there flat out reject her, finding out the man she loves is the biggest threat to her claim (a throne she full heartedly belonged to her since Viserys died) definitely hit her ego hard. It wasn’t all easy obviously, but when she was in Essos towards the later seasons, she was winning like MJ in the 90’s. The biggest hits to her were when she lost her dragons and Missandei, her best friend. Yeah, no shit she’d want to kill everyone and start a new world full of people who loved her. In the end, she was the worst villain in the show’s history. Gave me big Thanos Endgame vibes.

Jon’s story was perfect, especially the ending. Game of Thrones is all about putting down the mythical hero legend in favor of realistic expectations. Jon being a noble, good hearted, humble guy who finds out he’s the heir to the throne? Sure it would work in other stories, but not here. And if he did sit on the throne, he’d be unhappy. He got his happy ending by going back to the North up with Tormund and Ghost. He gets to be free and live his life. Yes I know his sentence was to be a part of the Nights Watch, but with the Unsullied leaving and his family being the most powerful people in Westeros, I don’t think anyone would give a shit if he decided to live among the Wildlings.

Sansa was badass. I didn’t like her story the first time I saw it but now that I saw the series again, I really did buy into her growth. She goes from an innocent little girl to an intelligent, savvy political operator, while still keeping her good heart and loyalty. It’s these characters that are the heroes of Game of Thrones. The smart ones who are willing to do what it takes to win for the people, not because of some lofty ideal or their personal ambition.

Arya’s story was alright early in the show but I did definitely appreciated that she killed the Night King. It would’ve been a waste to have her train for years without actually doing something big.

Now on the Night King and how the White Walkers died in one episode. I don’t think the point of the show was to have the White Walkers wage a full out war with the living for an entire season, it’s how this world ending crisis would kill everyone unless they put their petty differences aside. And for the most part, they did. The Night King’s impact changed the course of the world forever. After all, he killed Daenerys’ dragon and gave Cersei the opportunity to press her forces while everyone else dealt with him, definitely putting Daenerys on the path to be a psychotic killer. The Long Night was a terrific episode. What changed my view on it was by not treating it like some epic battle like Helm’s Deep in LOTR, it was just purely surviving hell. The darkness helped with creating such a sense of dread and fear. It’s not about winning some big battle, it’s about realizing you have no chance fighting head on, and praying your Hail Mary would work.

Bran as king? Yes. Why wouldn’t we want someone who has his powers being the king? Forget the valiant heroes and idealists, they are terrible leaders (in real life too). We need the all knowing, non ambitious people. 

The cinematography and music was some of the greatest, not just in the show, but in all of TV and movies.

There were definitely some issues, but overall, I really really loved Season 8. I don’t care what anyone else says, I think it’s a terrific ending. Downvote me to hell.",2021-07-27 02:05:32

[SPOILERS] Do you think Daenerys was truly evil?,5,oryo03,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/oryo03/spoilers_do_you_think_daenerys_was_truly_evil/,37,1627305945.0,"This is, perhaps, a silly question that has been discussed from time to time, but I had this debate with a few friends lately and was pleasantly surprised at how polarizing the debate was. Half of my friend group believed Dany was not truly evil. She simply was a good, well-intended person with very questionable tactics towards the end of her life and fell victim to circumstance. The other half believed Dany was evil, that she was a villian who never actually had any good intentions and was arguably the most self-serving character on the show. I took the side of the latter half. This will be a somewhat long post, but I will be making my case here.

My pro-Dany friends argued that she couldn't possibly have been a villain because she was well-meaning and did so many good deeds in her pursuit to the Iron Throne. However, I don't think this argument is entirely valid. Human history is FILLED with evil people who genuinely believed they were right. Very few evil people actually see themselves as evil. Intentions alone are not enough to justify a person's gruesome actions. When you publicly execute the innocent along with the guilty parties, burn people alive for not ""bending the knee"", and completely burn a city to ash in a blind rage of fire, you are evil.

Also let's examine a lot of these good deeds that Dany carried out in her pursuit to Westoros. She claimed she was doing all these things for the sake of creating a better world and for the prosperity of the people. She VERY rarely (if at all) did anything in the entire story that was not for her own personal gain.

""She freed the slaves"" and made sure to constantly remind them of who it was that freed them to ensure their undying fidelity.

""She overthrew tyrants."" Yes and these tyrants conveniently happened to be ruling over a city that she wanted to rule for herself. A lot of her evil nature was masked or overlooked because, at the time, the actions of those she was killing were worse than her own.

She constantly touted that she wanted to ""break the wheel"" and create a better world but could not fathom the mere possibility that this could happen without her being the ruler. She didnt want to BE good, otherwise she would have at least considered the possibility of this better world being created without her being at the top. She wanted to APPEAR good and be revered as the selfless, benevolent ""breaker of chains""

Her goals were always to seize the throne and be adored by her subjects. Sure she seemed to be gentler than many other monarchs depicted in the show, She showed kindness when she knew it wouldn't make her life harder, and seemed somewhat capable of compassion, but never if it even slightly interfered with the power she sought. 

Remember when Jon Snow's true parentage was revealed? She knew that he would be a great ruler because he was selfless, a proven leader, and trusted by the Northerners, but she could not tolerate any future in which she was not the one sitting on the throne. The possibility of a ""better world"" being completely feasible with a different ruler was not something she would stand for. She didn't welcome the potentially prosperous reign that Jon could have; she simply saw him as a threat because it was entirely possible the people of Westoros would prefer his rule to hers. 

Samwell Tarly's line to Jon perfectly encapsulates this concept: ""You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same""

Daenarys also displays a LOT of narcissism in that she seemed to genuinely believe she is some omnipotent entity that is the singular judge of what is good for the world. Before the march on King's Landing, Jon finally saw (or perhaps just stopped ignoring) the fact that her lust for power was far greater than her desire to create a better world. He believed that the people of the Seven Kingdoms could be entrusted to decide what is good and what is not. Dany immediately dismissed this idea and said very plainly ""They don't get to choose.""

In conclusion, yes, Daenerys Targaryen is evil.",2021-07-26 18:55:45

Probably going to get a lot of down votes but I have to just say I still really liked the end of the show.
I just see so many posts and memes shitting on it I wanted to know if there was anyone else out there that felt the same. 

1. Was it the most perfect ending? No. There are many other ways I would have preferred it ending but that doesn't mean the way it did end was horrible.

2. Was it rushed? Yes and I am sure there are reasons for this outside of the show itself that I do not know about, I am not one of the fans that disects and does all the production research so I should have just not mentioned this point really.

3. Danaerys. Yes, she goes batshit crazy which kinda seems like opposite of what she was all about but at the same time, she has gone through so fucking much honestly any human being could lose their minds after what she has been through. 

4. The books. This mother trucker STILL hasn't written another book. They had nothing to go off of for the ending!!! There is a reason mr. George is famous and that's because he made all this shit up in his head and did we really expect the show writers to just be as amazing as he was? They had enorenormous pressure to end a story that millions of people fell in love with and they weren't even the ones who came up with it in the first place. Sure, he gave them some major plot points and pointed them in the right direction but there was no way they could have came up with the same level of material as he would, especially when he can't even end the damn thing!!

All in all I dont see how the ending was horrible, was it perfect? No but it was still a great story and to those people who say the ending ruined the entire show and no one should even bother watching, fuck that. Even of you didn't like the ending, you cannot fucking say the first however many seasons weren't fucking amazing. 

Anyways, I'm kind of drunk so yeah, I just needed to say all of this, bring on the comments 🤪😅

[spoilers] the acquiring of the unsullied army,2,orfii9,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/orfii9/spoilers_the_acquiring_of_the_unsullied_army/,11,1627233088.0,"I have been rewatching the show recently. The whole story of how Dany Targarean was able to acquire the unsullied army feels like a child's story and thought. Even in the books, it was not drastically different. The idea that u can buy a warrior then ask that warrior to kill its own previous owner  easily is very unrealistic and childish and even a bit stupid. 

Especially those are highly trained warriors with very specific rule to follow rules. As the main seller and trainer, the first rule I would instill, never attack me! I am above all, including ur new owner. Dany cannot be the first person to ever think of this stupid plan. 

I know the fact that she bought all of them meant there is no one to defend. But the seller would've known that, he would've had a rule of a max purchase by one person. The trainer didn't have any contingency plan for this very stupid and easily anticipated move by Danny. 

Anyway I look at it, it feels too flimsy of a plot to acquire an army without doing anything smart. I love the smartness of game of thrones plots (especially in the book) but this one is too weak by even normal movie /show standards

It is just a rant / to see if others disagree or have some aspects I didn't think of",2021-07-25 22:41:28
[SPOILERS] Why would Illyn Payne and the Kingsguard disobey Cersei Lannister?,12,orf06t,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/orf06t/spoilers_why_would_illyn_payne_and_the_kingsguard/,15,1627231491.0,"The execution of Ned Stark is considered a big mistake by pretty much everyone in the show. If you think about it, what is bizarre is that it was carried out at all. I mean, sure, it was technically ordered by King Joffrey, but it was a last-minute decision that was clearly not supported by Queen Cersei.

At the time, Joffrey was a boy-king whose power completely relied on his maternal family. His paternal uncles considered him a bastard and sought to overthrow him. Say you were in Illyn Payne's shoes against this backdrop and Joffrey gives you some irrevocable order (such as killing Ned Stark), wouldn't you make sure this was approved by Queen Cersei as well?

I mean, it would have been understandable if Ilyn Payne wanted to refrain from being seen openly defying a direct order from his king, but there was a pretty chaotic situation and it seemed as though he could have given the small council members (who were all visibly shocked) a little more time to plead with Joffrey instead of acting like a mindless robot.

Another bizarre thing is that neither Illyn Payne nor any of the Kingsguard were ever punished by Queen Cersei or Tywin Lannister (who are otherwise very vengeful people) for their stupidity later on.",2021-07-25 22:14:51

[SPOILERS] In the end Dany just becomes a bitter woman.,11,oreo1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/oreo1v/spoilers_in_the_end_dany_just_becomes_a_bitter/,16,1627230395.0,"I want to preface this with the fact that I share the same criticisms of the last 2 seasons like most people. Terrible writing, rushed writing, characters becoming dumb overnight etc.

However I think the writing involving Dany was decent if not good. A lot of people see burning kings landing as some out of character moment for her but watching her growth it seemed like it's most natural conclusion. While they were slavers and potentially deserved their punishment, crucifying someone is an abhorrent practice. Then she burns the heads of a great house instead of imprisoning them (and then wonders why she sees no love in westero.) Her fall from grace wasn't overnight, it was just handled terribly because of the pacing of the last 2 seasons.

The biggest reason I believe she becomes like this is Jon. She quite clearly loves him. She sacrificed one of her sons for him, loses Jorah because of him, delayed taking the Iron throne because of him. She's sacrificed for him, and is angered when he can't overcome the fact they're related. Cersei definitely played her role killing Missandei and a dragon, but the key scene is when she decides on fear not love when Jon refuses her advances. Jon played more of a role in burning kings landing than Cersei did, simply because he didn't want to bang his aunt.

In the end as sad as it is the parallels between her and Cersei are blatant. Not only the bloodlust, but the incest. Cersei becomes queen so she can finally be with Jamie in peace. I imagine Dany had the same thoughts about being with Jon, forcing him to be with her and eliminating anyone who would be against it.

I'm sad she turns out to be her worst fear, but ultimately her and Cersei become monsters to save the only love they had left in the world, and both kill thousands if not millions in the process.",2021-07-25 21:56:35

Seeing the prospect and with a thirst to not leave any stones or in this case, bodies unturned, he brought out his sword. he could very well understand that both of them had Valyrian steel so he knew what he was up against, But he was the Night King.

Both of them charged and then the battle began, One that was foreshadowed years ago and the one for redemption, which Jaime had been fighting for ever so long. They came and fought, twisted and turned and the Night king made them look like 2 amateurs up against a seasoned professional. As John finally succumbed and lay on the ground, almost breathless, Jaime looked up and realized this was the moment his whole was waiting for. He could finally let go of Cersei and had found real love and he had gotten everything that he had ever wanted, except, redemption.

With one last breath, he went one for a 1v1 that children in the future would sing songs about. As the swords collided and they clashed with all their might, Jaime was almost done, on his last breath, as the Night King took Jaime's own sword, forged by Tywin from the noble Ned Stark's Ice, and plunged into his heart. With a look of pain but satisfaction, Jaime tumbled to the ground, on the way to go back to his mother and father when all of a sudden from behind John lay one last charge, But as valiantly as he fought, The Night King got the better of him and plunged his dagger right until a body leapt on him, who could that be he thought, No one would be the answer.

As the King's sword entered Jon, Arya also pulled the infamous dagger, that started the show and the war of the five kings and Plunged it onto the night king, finally settling the long night at last. This time, Azhor ahai and Lightbringer were two different but they had achieved what he had before.

I spent the past 5 years holding on the seasons that were made past the books published. With the 10th anniversary of the publishing of A Dance with Dragons I finally gave in, convinced that either George R.R. will never finish them, or that he has them ready to be out once he's dead.

Now that I know how this ends, I understand why people were so mad -although I don't share the sentiment... completely- and now truly believe the author will never publish while alive, if at all.

But I wanted to come here to know how you all feel. 

IMO the TV series follows very close what the remaining two books may have -minus half a dozen characters and side plots, albeit- and the spirit of SOIAF is well kept. 

Any character may fall or rise at any given time, regardless of what they have suffered or achieved; the grab of power may give some moments of glory but it always fades; what the reader considers fair is irrelevant; all may be for nothing at all.

And it's because of this that I truly feel appalled by Brandon becoming king. I don't mind Dany dying such a simple dead, neither that Jon never got to be/enjoy his true self. I believe those fates were in line with SOIAF.

However, the manner in which Brandon gets the crown, and the just and basic sense of goodness and fairness that comes with (he doesn't want power, and he's the memory of men) is just unbearable after being hit by the full force of irrelevance, blunt insignificance assigned to Dany's journey. The mix of ""nothing means anything"" but ""the good boy who was always good deserves it""

That, I truly hated.

But what do you all think about it? Why did you love or hate the ending of the TV series? And do you also think the reaction to it is why George may never publish, or is waiting till he's gone to avoid the hate?",2021-07-23 09:09:45

[SPOILERS] A game of thrones videogame idea,24,ooo5wo,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ooo5wo/spoilers_a_game_of_thrones_videogame_idea/,33,1626867698.0,"There needs to be a game of thrones videogame. Yes, I know about the shitty RPG, the Telltale game, and Skyrim. The RPG (as mentioned) was shit. The Telltale game looks cool but isn't what I want. Skyrim is a wonderful game but I'd like to have a game in the actual universe of ASOIAF. You know with Targaryens, House Stark, all the important locations like Winterfell and Kings Landing. Also with White Walkers, Wargs, and all the different races and creatures of the series/universe.

I'd instantly fall in love with a new RPG for the next generation of consoles and PC. With nice graphics and all. Open World with all the major locations. Well, a map with every location from the game of thrones series would be huge, maybe first the north and then each kingdom as a later DLC, I don't know. You have a preset protagonist but can change almost everything about the protagonist such as clothes hairstyle etc. You have quests (main and sidequests) but you do not know which quest is a main or a sidequest. Similar to Skyrim or RDR2 there are people around the map giving you random quests. Maybe you can even build your own army and attack castles (that feature would be huge but, I use that word rarely, \*epic\*). You can learn abilities like warging into animals. Maybe you could even become a white walker and do missions for them. What about owning a dragon? Just imagine going mad and destroying Kings Landing with a dragon, just like Daenerys did (btw that scene in the show made no sense but seems fun in a videogame, call me mad). Also, it would be nice if there was destruction such as buildings getting destroyed if you burn them down with a dragon.

I know such a game will never happen but let me dream. I believe there will be GOT games especially since HBO is beginning to milk the franchise with new shows. It will still take years just like the Harry Potter franchise is just getting a big RPG next year (A whole decade after the last movie).  

Have a great day!",2021-07-21 17:11:38

I love to write Ocs, it is my weakness... I wanted to give some kind of magic to an oc and either make them a servant of the Starks or make them an actual Stark... either way they would be able to see the dead and or feel the emotions of others... No one would believe them, so they would mask their power and use it for good as much as they could.

If I go mediumship

1. They would know of the White Walkers early and could prepare as much as they could.
2. They would know of the evils of certain people but not all as not everyone.
3. If they are a Stark, the family is hesitant around them as they know more than they ought to.
4. They could and would be able to know how awful Robert is early on.

If I go Empathy...

1. They would sense Jon Snow's pain early and help him gain some confidence, at the cost of the world being unprepared for the White Walkers.
2. They would manifest their powers as terrible migraines at first and be afraid of the Lannisters and loathe Robert.
3. They would also be able to sense emotions that linger making it hard for them to handle graveyards and Kingslanding...
4. They would be more healer than warrior and more scholar.
5. They would resent Catlyn for the pain she causes Jon Snow.

In either case their gifts would be discovered and they would be forced to work for the Lannisters... they would have an automatic foe in Varys who hates magic...

I chose these two powers as they are not overly magical and follow the line of more subtle powers the show is so famous for. 

The idea is pretty loose so far, that is why I am on here asking for thoughts, suggestions and whatnot... Really I am open to any and all suggestions.",2021-07-21 12:37:02
[SPOILERS] How Would You Have Done This Relationship?,17,oodx99,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/oodx99/spoilers_how_would_you_have_done_this_relationship/,13,1626824077.0,"Arya and Gendry, probably one of the healthier relationships on the show, and sadly the one that went down in the second highest flames. Obviously it was meant to mirror Lyanna Stark and Robert Baratheon. But does anyone else think it was a huge change in character for Gendry to propose to Arya like that? I mean sure the lad is running high on the adrenaline of the Battle of Winterfell and having just been made a Lord, but he knows better than anyone that Arya didn't want to be a lady, and him proposing just seemed way off from how I imagine he would have reacted.

Personally I would have kept the scene similar, but mirrored their conversation at Hollow Hill, the infamous ""I can be your family"" line. It would have been a wonderful callback and I think maybe Arya would have responded better to that than ""marry me"". Obviously there is still the issue of Arya not wanting to be tied down, but it removes the presumptive air that Gendry is going to try to make Arya behave like a typical Lady. I wouldn't even mind if she still said no, like he did to her, but I feel like it would have been far more bittersweet and fitting for both characters if it had gone this way.

i absolutely adored seasons 1-6 with season 5 being my least favorite up until episode 8 of that season where it gets incredible.  i loved daenerys and i loved jon as well as many other characters ofc.  season 7 in my opinion was undoubtedly the best season of the show.  everyone was exactly where they needed to be and all my favorite characters were succeeding.  jon and daenerys seem as though they are meant to be together and their love feels truly natural.  jon befriending the dragons was wonderful.  i do wish that daenerys had a sweet moment with Ghost.  that said, the last 30 minutes of the last episode of season 7 really ruin a lot for me.  i hate the dragon dying and becoming undead and i hate the revelation that jon is not a snow or stark and i hate even more that he is related to daenerys.  i think that the first three episodes of season 8 are great with the exception of any discussions about jons heritage.  after that its a shit show and i cant stand daenerys character arc ending up as a villain.  i do not like jon being sent away having just killed the love of his life and i do not like bran ruling.

in my perfect world this is how the show would have ended:
seasons 1-7 go exactly as they were made except for the final episode of season 7 and also except for the early realization that jon is not neds son.  

while daenerys is saving jon from being trapped by the army of dead, instead of her dragon being killed, it is wounded badly and flys away.  

in season 8, while daenerys is discussing her love for jon with sansa, instead of someone interrupting, daenerys confessed that she intended to rule the seven kingdoms with jon by her side.  hence the song of ice and fire.  ice and fire uniting to bring peace to the world.

instead of jorja mormont saving daenerys when she is trapped in the long night, she finds herself completely alone and surrounded.  there is no hope until her wounded dragon finally returns and saves her.  soon after, jon and daenerys both ride dragons with the armies to kings landing and take the throne without causing needless mass destruction.  i dont have an opinion with what happens to cersei but i would want the show to end with jon marrying daenerys.

daenerys becoming a villain almost negates the whole show for me.  i have no interest in ever rewatching it because her journey in becoming a strong and kind leader is pointless now.

im not sure if anyone will read this whole thing but i felt like sharing my thoughts.  let me know if you would like my opinion on anything lol.",2021-07-21 00:01:02

This scene struck me as it's one of the most intense few pages of literature i have ever read and was a fantastic way of developing the Hounds character with him drunkenly oversharing.

However a noticeable difference in the show is that instead of the hound telling his own story its littlefinger describing what happened to him. The first link is me reading the passage from the book and the second is the scene from the show, for refrence.

https://youtu.be/bRzQlSo0NWw

https://youtu.be/BKpId6tu7Lo

Adide from Little Fingers telling being a sub par second hand story as compared to the Hounds first hand recount of the situation, it makes no sense that littlefinger would know what happened in the first place. In the book, the Hound threatens Sansas life if she speaks to anyone of what he told her that evening, meaning this is something he doesn't want anyone to know of. I understand little finger has a network of spies but it seems that up to this point the only people that should know what happened are Sandor, Gregor and Sansa

Countless characters said throughout the show to not trust Cersei.  The question then arises of how she did it, how she feigned surrender.
  The only way she could’ve done it, is if the bells ringing didn’t truly mean surrender.  This is hinted at in the show when they don’t show Cersei giving the order to ring the bells.  In the show, the bells are rung when one king dies and another king is anointed.  The bells always meant there’s going to be a new king or queen, suspiciously and easily disguising a surrender.  She has a son in her belly, so it rang true.  Or maybe it’s just something new, and she would have a new dragon for her son.  
  This is in the books.  There’s a passage where Tywin says the bells mean there will be a new king, and that’s all that they mean.  So perhaps it should be called Tywin’s deception, not Cersei’s.  
  Cersei doesn’t appear to be in the process of surrendering.  She’s high in the Red Keep with her most dangerous weapon, the Mountain.  She’s not going  towards the exit with a white flag.  In part, surrendering is going to the enemy.  Let’s not forget that Cersei gave the Mountain an order to kill Daenerys, if things went wrong, and it was never shown her cancelling that order.  
  If you look at Daenerys while she’s listening to the bells, she starts to get angry.  She doesn’t look crazy.  She looks like she just realized Cersei was deceiving them with the bells.  Bells can just symbolize something new, maybe with a ‘like a dragon’ added on.  Daenerys knows that if she lands, Cersei will have her killed.  There are likely hired assassins dispersed in the crowd.  She was smart to just burn them.  She was smart to burn down the Red Keep.  She can’t face Cersei without being killed by the Mountain, or who knows how many people in the Red Keep would kill her if she walked in.  
  Daenerys didn’t go crazy(well, she does look crazy in love when she sees John next).  She recognized the threat posed by Cersei.  Cersei is not to be trusted.  There are dozen of ways Cersei could have done it, but I think this angle is best supported by evidence from the books and show.  The bells mean something other than surrender.",2021-07-20 05:34:21

It's so hokey. It's so badly acted. It's even badly filmed because Meera made it all of what, fifty feet because of Hodors sacrifice? The scene is taking a second rate joke and trying to turn it into an emotional key moment. It mistakes Hodors dependency on others for loyalty, Brans domination of his mind for love and marks the series' trend of selling contrivances as clever twists. 

Absolutely was one of the moments where I saw the series with new eyes and started seriously doubting where they were going with this. Am I missing something here? Is this supposed to be tragic and I don't see it? Does Bran ever get any kind of comeupance or at least gets chewed out for basically mind-raping a little boy into dying for him? This whole plotline for me is coloured by the ending, so that might be part of an explanation.

But I'd honestly be curious how others see it now. I remember that scene being powerful for some viewers, because we've known Hodor for so long at that point. Do you think it holds up?",2021-07-20 00:34:06

Let the idiots in Westeros kill each other.

on s1e2, he killed the butcher's son, just a kid, because of Joffrey. when I watched that episode, my opinion about him was that he was such a heartless bad guy.

as the seasons passed, I started liking and understanding him more. arya and brienne have a lot to do with him as well. they kinda shaped him to be who he was on the ending.

when he returned after almost dying in the fight with brienne I felt so happy. I also think that his death on ""the bells"" was very honorable. I mean, fighting with his mad brother and falling off the red keep was not the ending I wanted - of course I'd like him to be alive - but certainly it was very decent, one of the couple that season had.

sure, at the end of the day he's not the best person in the world but at least he tries to be good (with some people lol)

Just wanted to share w you what I think about him. This is my opinion, idk about you guys, but for me, he's one of the best characters of the series.

Disclaimer: I don't remember exactly the small details of the plot so if I get anything wrong pls correct me. also, there are so many more things I could say about his story and arch but  I'm sleepy and lazy rn, so good night fellas, thanks for reading this and, as always, peace",2021-07-18 11:01:44

[Spoilers] An Issue I have with the storyline in Season 8 of the TV Show,11,omcvhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/omcvhl/spoilers_an_issue_i_have_with_the_storyline_in/,21,1626556321.0,"So I was thinking about how angry Daenerys was about Jon being Aegon Targaryen and how she keeps saying how “peaceful” everything was “with a Targaryen on the iron throne”. I mean story wise - with her being batshit - it does makes sense. But even, the main characters, including Jon, should’ve realized she was just power-hungry and greedy and wanted to control everything herself. It had nothing to do with being a Targaryen or believing that she would bring peace to the world. Basically, they should’ve seen that she was a total tyrant - especially regarding the North wanting to be free from the 7 kingdoms.

It literally makes no logical sense to be mad about Jon being a Targaryen OR about the North being an “independent kingdom”.

1) If the North was an independent kingdom, Jon/Aegon Targaryen would be the King in the North. So a Targaryen would still be ruling the North.

2) Ignoring the issues with the North wanting to be independent (and this particular point has bothered them hell out of me since it first aired), Jon says multiple times: “I don’t want it”, “You are my Queen”, “I will refuse the throne”. Daenerys argues by saying that even if Jon were to refuse the throne, people would *make* him take it. That he’d have no choice in the matter. Which is bullshit —and Jon of all people should’ve known this and pointed it out: 

Aemon Targaryen was meant to be King, also. He did not want it. He did not feel he was suited to rule. So he refused the throne. He took the black and went to the wall, he then became a master and served at Castle Black until he died. Leaving the throne to his brother.

If her argument made sense, Aemon would not have been able to do that. He would’ve been made to take the throne regardless. All Jon had to do was tell her about Aemon. 

<Like, how many times does she say that she’s the last Targaryen. And she says it TO Jon, like, why is no one telling her about Aemon?>

Just wanted to see what your guys thoughts on these ideas are. 

Thanks! :)",2021-07-18 02:42:01

[SPOILERS] Book vs. Show preferences.,24,ol7kd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ol7kd3/spoilers_book_vs_show_preferences/,38,1626402344.0,"Any scenes in the show you prefer to the book? 
I just finished A Feast for Crows, and have yet to read A Dance With Dragons. Obviously the books are far richer and are still ongoing while the show is not, and each is their own medium. I was wondering if there are any scenes from the show that you enjoyed more than how it was originally depicted in the book, and why. 

For me, Tyrion’s trial hit better in the show. His speech culminating in his request for trial-by-combat while he doesn’t know he will have a champion in Oberyn? Amazing. Maybe I’m biased to Peter Dinklage’s performance, but I felt he was at his wit’s end in the show and knew his last resort was the biggest insult to Tywin. In the book it just felt less fiery to me, I guess. 

I do prefer Jaime confessing the Tysha lie to Tyrion. It let’s Tyrion know that he is lovable. In the show it’s just never brought up. 

Anybody else have some thoughts? (And remember, I haven’t read A Dance With Dragons so no spoilers please)",2021-07-16 07:55:44

I'm currently in rewatch number something and I've always thought there was some connection between the two. To me the show kinda implies it in at least one instance, though I think there was more but I can't think of them off hand.

**Evidence:** In season 2 when the Night Watch March beyond The Wall and stay at Krastor's, he says something along the lines to LC Mormont ""aren't you jealous of my wives"" and LC Mormont replies ""we chose different paths.""

Maybe I'm just seeing things that aren't there but the delivery of it seems to go a lot deeper than acquaintances speaking to eachother.

[SPOILERS] What I would have done differently,294,ok00xf,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/ok00xf/spoilers_what_i_would_have_done_differently/,102,1626251282.0,"So its been a while since season 8 now and I've thought a lot since then about what I would change to the show if I was the one to write it.

A lot of people thought Dani's change to mad queen was rushed and I still think it was a smidge but after rewatching the signs are all there for her gradual decline into madness so I wouldn't change that.

At the battle for winterfell I think Jamie should have died, as it would have completed his redemption arc, dying while fighting in winterfell along with the North, the same place he pushed bran out the window. Would have been a meaningful moment for him to die defending brienne who in my opinion he loved more than cersei.

Also a few more major characters should have died in the battle, seemed a bit lackluster for me that the named characters that did die like lady mormont and the night watch commander (can't remember his name) were small roles, the biggest loss was probably jorah and theon but with it being the long night, the thing that had been teased from day 1, it should have been a lot more deadly.

With Jamie's death it would open up the possibility for arya to use Jamie's face to return to kings landing and finally kill cersei after years of waiting, the show could have pulled a massive misdirect and only shown Jamie's death as a flashback when he(arya) kills cersei. There could be a few scene of jamie and briene travelling to kings landing and talking about what they are going to do after it was all over of whatever, but we don't know it's arya at that point, something like that.

How excatly arya would kill cersei I've yet to decide but it would either be really brutal or really emotional and meaningful, or both I guess, but it would be a better death for Jamie and cersei, rather than ya know, getting crushed by some rubble caused by Dani going full mad queen.

Which leaves the death of the night King up to someone else so that ayra doesn't seem massively OP, maybe bran could weaken the night king somehow because they are supposed to have a deep connection, maybe he could have actually been the bait all along but not in the way he explained to the others, and that would leave the night king weak enough for theon to take him down, completing his redemption arc, helping save the boy who he once lied about burning alive. 

With theon surviving, and the iron islands no longer needing to be held by yara incase of the loss of the long night, theon and yara could be at the battle of kings landing fighting off against Euron so the battle took place over land and sea and seemed like a larger scale battle, the fight between Jamie and euron that happened in the show would be replaced with Euron and yara, euron would probably win in a straight fight but something could happen to turn the tide, maybe theon could be ramming cannon fire into the ship they are fighting on and euron gets caught by some debris, then ultimately yara ends up winning and killing euron and becomes the first queen of the iron islands after the battle.

I love the show and although the last season isn't on par with the rest I still really liked it but I feel like it could have been better, interested to see if you guys agree that any of this sounds better, or what if anything you would change about it.",2021-07-14 13:58:02

If she refused a reasonable surrender offer from Cersei bargained by tyrion/jaime (she betrayed me too many times ect, you were wrong about her before) and forced an invasion you would still have massive casualties, the rape, ect.

But man season 1 is so frustrating. Honestly most of the bloodshed throughout the series could have just been avoided if Ned went along with Renly and Littlefinger. Renly said he could have gotten 100 men, whether that was his or his and Loris Tyrell's. Littlefinger could have delivered the Gold Cloaks and not betrayed Ned. Once they seized Joffery, Ned could have played along until Stannis arrived back in the capitol and then Ned could have turned over the Kingdoms to him. 

You'd probably still have a war with the Lannisters but at least Ned wouldn't of been beheaded, and the Red Wedding wouldn't have happened. 

I really hate they killed Ned off so quickly and I wish there was an alternate series where it played out like this. In general there's a lot of things about the show that I wish went differently such as the whole army of the dead and dragons storylines. I never cared too much about them.

Another part of the show that's insanely frustrating to watch for me is Rickon's death. Why tf did this dumb mfer run in a straight ass line while they shoot arrows at him and he can see them landing right next to him. Like tf you doing, zig and zag bitch.

Edit: another scene that frustrates me is when the Lannisters come for Arya after King Robert dies. Why tf didn't Serio just pick up one of the swords from the dudes he just beat. A lot of dumb people in the GOT world. If you grabbed a sword he may have been able to kill the Kingsguard but noooo let's use that oversized toothpick as a weapon.",2021-07-13 10:33:34

The show buthered Arya's reunions (at least imo I was let down but share your thoughts pls) and he's not going to mess those up.",2021-07-13 00:03:07

[SPOILERS] Re-watched and everything Dany did was believable until...,55,oiofm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/oiofm2/spoilers_rewatched_and_everything_dany_did_was/,63,1626085126.0,"I watched the show in real time as it aired, which was difficult as by the latter seasons I had forgotten a lot of the details of the early seasons. The end was a shock and disappointment to me as it was to many.

But then I re-watched the series within a couple of months and the continuity of the story and characters held up much better in the re-watch. Yes, it's true, certain things seemed rather far-fetched, such as Varys throwing his normal caution to the wind, but by and large the main problem I'd had with the show in the first viewing was drastically reduced.

Dany's nature doesn't really change throughout the show. If you re-watch it you will see Dany as the ruthless tyrant she is destined to become, even in the earlier seasons. Like most tyrants, she is generous and kind to those who are faithful and obedient to her. In the early seasons, when she kills people, we are rooting for her because we think the people she's killing suck.

The assault on King's Landing episode is actually quite powerful if you look at it and ignore Dany. The fact that the northerners turn into murdering rapists is more interesting and sad than anything Dany does - it shows the true horror of warfare. They're supposed to be the good guys.

And this episode is the one time that I find Dany acts out of character and it makes little sense. Everything she does up to the ringing of the bells is fine and consistent with her character. Was the writing as good in Season 8 as Season 1-4? No. But Dany's character consistency is mostly fine. Up to the ringing of the bells.

Cercei and her army were backstabbers. Dany and her army literally saved the world and Cercei sat there and waited to stab them in the back. It would be like - imagine aliens attacked earth and, like a Hollywood movie, the USA tried to rally the world's militaries in defense. Imagine the major powers agreed to put aside their differences and fight the aliens together. Imagine it's a brutal war with astronomical casualties, but we somehow pull it off. Except one country, China, decided to sit the war out and build up their army, and when the aliens are finally defeated China goes on a rampage and  invades the USA. It would be the most evil thing a nation has ever done in the history of our species. By sitting the war out for their own personal gain, they would have put the entire human species in jeopardy. I would consider it the worst betrayal in history, the worst crime.

This is what Cercei does. The army of the dead seems to be about to exterminate all life and it seems the night king will win, and yet Dany fights against him despite the odds, and Cercei uses the events to her advantage. It's a truly evil betrayal and Cercei and the entire Lannister army deserve to be vaporized by dragonfire. The Golden Company too.

So Dany flying around and nuking the shit out of the army makes sense. If she had completely blown up the Red keep that would make sense too. ~~But why does she take her time flying up and down the streets to burn the irrelevant peasants running away? THAT makes no sense.~~

~~She's trying to conquer the city, to live in it, to sit on the throne. It makes no sense for her to turn it to ash first. She's not even getting revenge on anyone at that point. It would even make more sense for her to burn down Casterly Rock, or blow up the Iron Bank. The city of King's Landing has been her dream her whole life. Burning it and all the people within it is unexplainable.~~

~~And that scene, where she takes off after the bells ring, looking at the Red Keep... and then spends hours burning everything other than the Red Keep - that makes no sense.~~

I've read the explanations offered in this thread and I thought about the dialogue in the last episode more and yes, even Dany's burning of KL does make sense and is consistent with her character. I think most of us still agree it was a dick move of D&D to condense the final two seasons and this descent into genocide should have been given more than one episode, but ultimately it is consistent with Dany's previous path/trajectory.

I know a lot of book readers didn't like a lot of the stuff with the show and where it diverted.  I had the same issue as a book reader of the Harry Potter books and as a result never really enjoyed the movies nearly as much as the books.  Same thing with liking the book The Martian way more than the movie.  So it was interesting to do the show first and then the books after.  To my surprise I actually preferred the direction that the show went in a lot of areas compared to the books.  I was also surprised at how little Lady Stoneheart was in the books seeing as that was a common complaint of book readers during the show that she was left out entirely.


The one thing from the books though that was far better than the show was the Young Griff storyline in the 5th book.  Really the highlight of that book and how that all ultimately plays out if George ever releases Winds of Winter is what I'm looking forward to most.  Very disappointing for the show to leave all of that out completely.  Seeing how much they rushed trying to warp up the show and storylines I guess it makes sense because that could have really allowed them to extend the show out several more full seasons.  That doesn't make it the right decision at all though.  The show should have kept going instead of the rapid sloppy finish it had.  



What is the consensus among book readers though with Young Griff?  Do people believe he is Aegon Targaryen or are there theories that he is not actually?  The epilogue sure seems to hint at him being legitimate.",2021-07-12 00:43:53

He actively knew about enemies, had a network of birds spreading everywhere seemingly.

This guy could uncover harpies, maybe not the full organization but at least could easily predict attacks or could have known from his birds when masters were planning attack on Mereen. If he doesn't have a network can he not re-establish it. The only place where his network was gone was the King's Landing.

He could have known about Euron's involvement with the crown and now that crown has a navy. He never even advised Dany on anything. He just watched as everything happened  and usually talked to Tyrion, that's it just talk about exposition.

Firstly did people like the way it happened in the show? I dont remember Thorne taking part in it in books and felt like that was out of character for him to do so (though its been a long while).  He's a prick but betraying the Night's Watch goes against his beliefs. It also didn't make much sense. Killing Jon for letting wildlings in after it happened when there was nothing that could be done to change the decision was strange. In the books the mutiny happens for a variety of reasons including the pink letter. It actually seemed justified in the books. Not that Jon was doing anything wrong, but that both sides made alot of sense. Jon could not reasonably let his favorite younger sister be abused and the NIght's Watch could not reasonably allow him to march south with the wildlings. Like the red wedding and Ned's execution it was a series of mis-steps that got him killed, not 1 decision like the show. 

I also think the ressurrection itself will be different. Martin has said that Lady Stoneheart was created to show how coming back to life changes a person. I dont think Jon will continue being ""jon"" after he comes back. Part of me thinks that Melisandre needs Shireen to burn to bring Jon back since she uses burning as a source of power. Any other theories?

My friend said that Varys knows everything thanks to his little birds, and Pycelle planned to make Tyrion think that Varys knows the plan and told it to the queen. But, it makes everything worse because if it could be, then Varys might have known the plot and consciously told the queen about the plan.

In conclusion, his plot was based on the stupidity of Pycelle. I know, Tyrion already knew that the plot will work, but it was only because Varys is his friend, and he knows how stupid Pycelle is. So, I think it was a threat instead of a plot.

I grew up in a conservative family, so I missed out of the whole GOT series excitement when it was still airing. I heard a couple of things about the show over the years and yesterday I decided to watch it! 

I’m on Season 1 Episode 3 and I learned that you probably shouldn’t watch this show while exercising at the gym (Episode 2 with Khaleesi and Drogo👀)

I was wondering should I skip the last season because of all of the hate it received? Or did anyone enjoy the last season? Sorry if this is a sensitive topic!
Edit: dumb autocorrect changed Drogo to Diego haha",2021-07-10 00:44:55

The truth is that the reaction was so severe that it killed the franchise. IIRC there were three spin-offs proposed, we now only have one, merchandise disappeared from shops almost overnight, and so on. HBO must have been spitting blood. I hope they can reboot with House of the Dragon, but it still means hugely expensive lost opportunities. 

I don't accept the argument that it had anything to do with favourite characters being killed - there were favourite characters being killed here there and anywhere all through - Ned Stark, Red Wedding, etc. 

IMO it was that the behaviour of **almost every** character in the last season defied the logic of the character build up leading to there. Yes, if it had had more episodes then it might have made more sense, but as it was it simply didn't.  Add that to people's ability to levitate from one end of the country to the other, nonsense like hiding in the crypt from dead people, and the weapons that were deadly in one episode and helpless in the next, and it simply destroyed one's belief in the fictional world created. 

That kind of thing sometimes happens in books too, usually when an author gets stuck with a character or series that (s)he no longer likes. Even Sherlock Holmes suffers from it a bit.",2021-07-09 15:06:52

It sounds as if they're discussing how to prevent Littlefinger from absconding with Sansa.  But since Joffrey's death is forthcoming, the ""obvious"" solution Olenna alludes to could be assassinating the king.  But it's been a long time since I read the books, and I can't recall whether Varys assisted Olenna with Joffrey's assassination, or whether she/they intended that murder to nip the Littlefinger/Sansa problem in the bud as well.  Thanks for enlightening me!

*VARYS and OLENNA walk together.*  


*VARYS: I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still.*  


*OLENNA: Which is Sansa Stark?*  


*VARYS: Neither. A babe in the woods. I admired her father.*  


*OLENNA: Yes. Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?*  


*VARYS: I could not help Lord Stark. Perhaps I can help his daughter.*  


*OLENNA: How?*  


*VARYS: You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.*  


*OLENNA: That's hardly surprising. She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.*  


*VARYS: Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.*  


*OLENNA: It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.*  


*VARYS: Littlefinger is not long for the capital. A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.*  


*OLENNA: And why have you come to me with this matter?*  


*VARYS: Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army?*  


*OLENNA: (laughs)*  


*VARYS: Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North.*  


*OLENNA: And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket.*  


*VARYS: Which seems such a shame. Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?*  


*OLENNA: You must despise him. You're working so hard to undermine him.*  


*VARYS: Actually, I rather enjoy him. But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes.*  


*OLENNA: You are a clever man, Lord Varys.*  


*VARYS: You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution.*

I have a bit of change for that. I think it should've been better if they never showed him and rather than Arya killing the night king, he could. 

The story could be the children of the forest didn't let him die and chose him to kill the night king. He never appeared until nk approaching bran and Arya being busy somewhere else. He suddenly came on his horse with his mysterious weapon,and slew the nk.

After that,his watch ends. The reason they gave for jon as he died out there but was saved by the children. His becomes lord of winterfell with Sansa marrying Tyrion and forming an alliance there,and Arya marrying Gendry forming another alliance. While jon kills dany, he gets the iron throne. 

Rickon never dies. He becomes heir to winterfell after benjen. They could've added jon and benjen fighting alongside.

[NO SPOILERS] Finally reading the first ASOIAF novel and..,6,oge57p,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/oge57p/no_spoilers_finally_reading_the_first_asoiaf/,12,1625771451.0,"It’s actually really good so far.

1) As someone who watched the show I can’t help but mentally compare certain things in the show to the tv. Books always best the shows in the sense that it has more depth. But honestly it’s hard to visualize the characters as explained by George when the actors looked a little different. Joffrey is freaking TALL with blonde curls as well as other Lannisters? Daenerys has violet eyes? Tyrione has two different eye colors? Robb has auburn Tully hair? Jon snow and brown hair? Arrya has a long face and not a round one? Ik it’s minor but I can’t visualize them as anything but what I saw in the show. 

2) George is a master of describing the world of the story. The emotions, settings, actions. Paints a clear picture and has a way with words. Like how he introduced Daenerys was iconic. 

“Dany touched it. The cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water”. 

But I feel like he kind of over does it other times. Not every detail in my opinion needs to be vividly described. Beautifully said but it starts to feel like he’s trying to fill up pages instead of getting to the point. 

3) And speaking of Dany, seeing how down bad and weak she was in the beginning and how she will grow as the series progresses is what makes her arguably the best character in the series. Interested in seeing how George will handle her “descent into madness” arc differently than the show, I assume a bit slower. 

But overall I enjoy it as someone who has a good 500+ pages left. Interested in reading the other books as well.",2021-07-09 00:40:51

I've thought about this a lot recently and Stannis killing Renly was kind of a stupid move, strategically speaking. Sure, when he killed Renly he got rid of his competition and some of Renly's bannermen and swords pledged allegiance to Stannis, so on it's face it seems like a good idea. But when you think about it, Stannis wasn't the only party who benefitted for Renly's death. The Lannisters, who are currently winning, lost one of the major rebels against the crown AND got an alliance with the Tyrells, one of the most rich and powerful families in the seven kingdoms. And now the only person who competes with the Lannister's claim is: Stannis! And as for the North's secession, now that the Lannisters are as powerful as they are the Frey's and the Boltons weak ties are finally broken and the Starks all die, except for the one who the Lannisters control. And the Greyjoy's are basically an irrelevance to the Lannisters. Their only maor adversary is Stannis now. And while he has a big enough army, he is still stupid enough to waste it all on the battle if blackwater and he gets fucked in the ass by the Lannisters. It just doesn't make sense: when you're playing uno on family game night you don't use your plus 4 on the guy with 10 cards, you use it on the guy with 1. Stannis should've tried to make a move that benefits his position and hurts the Lannisters. If your move in any way helps the guy in first place, it's probably a bad move. As far as I can see, the Starks and Baratheons should squad up and gang rape the Lannisters and then figure it out from there. Stannis should've waited until the Lannister's were in a worse position before even thinking about making a move against renly, let alone just straight up murder him and lose half his bannermen to the guys who literally have the crown. If he didn't kill Renly, the Starks would never have been betrayed at the Red Wedding and the Lannisters would likely be overwhelmed and eventually lose the throne. And then, if Stannis killed renly the Bannermen would have nobody to go to except Stannis, he would have the backing of the Tyrells and Renly's army, and from there decide if he wanted to stop the north from seceding if they even still wanted to. Am I missing something or is Stannis just not that good at strategy?",2021-07-08 22:05:19

Comment,1,hcobn70,,0,1631529485.0,"It’s a great plan to rule the north if you don’t believe in the White Walkers. 
1. Sansa’s 1st born son would lay claim to Robb’s crown because by housing Sansa that is open rebellion against the crown.
2. The North is virtually untouched by the War of the 5 Kings except that a large part of the population has been culled by leaving with Robb (which was likely to happen during winter anyway and a previous Stark waged a war before winter for this very reason) so food store and infrastructure are intact.
3. Most lords died at the twins so Roose has about 20 years of Winter to rally the threat of the south to his cause with young impressionable lords and lady’s
4. The south during the most important autumn, spent all that time in constant civil war, killing and pillaging the small folk farmers to the point of famine before winter likely leading to mass starvation during winter while the least affected areas like Dorne have no reason to help the Crown survive Winter. 

Roose would have decades to prepare for eventual retaliation from the Crown once Winter was in full swing and would possibly be in a position to conquer the majority of the South depending on how the Winter played out….except he’d be zombie chow tho",2021-09-13 16:08:05

but that isn't it.  Its that he doesn't feel children should be punished for the sins of their parents, and has no problems sacrificing to protect them.... but in this world, this type of hard moral standing is deadly.

He keeps his sister's secret because Robert would kill Jon otherwise.  He steps down as Hand because he won't be part of Robert killing a child. He warns Cersei so she can run away with her children because he doesn't feel Joffrey, Marcella and Tommen deserves to be executed for her (and Jaime's) actions.  He agrees to betray his oath and honor, publically lie about Joffrey's lineage, in order to protect his girls.

Its not that he's not smart enough... its not that he's too honorable.  Its that his morality is his weakness.

Robb also has this same weakness.  The reason he executes Rickard Karstark is not because Rickard went against his orders, but because when Rickard did go against his orders it was in killing some Lannister children... and that was a bridge too far for him.",2021-09-13 15:51:09

And right up until his execution I was waiting for him to somehow miraculously save himself. His death really showed the audience (at least me), that this was serious.

That's true in any other circumstance, he would have told Robert immediately. But when Robert is on his deathbed, telling him accomplishes nothing but to make his suffering worse. Why tell a dying king that his wife cheated on him and the Lannisters have stolen the throne when it's too late for him to do anything about it?

Ned could have told him and then promised to take care of it for him, but again that accomplishes nothing, Ned was going to take care of it anyway, so all it does is make Robert's dying hours worse on him. Honor doesn't require doing that, he wanted his friend to die in peace.

> He did infact not write Robert's will down as it was told to him, he did not show honor in that vein. Robert may have not known Jeffrey was not his son, but that is who he wanted to be his successor.

If Robert had known, there is absolutely no doubt he would have disowned Joffrey and named Stannis his heir, and Ned knows this.

Comment,1,hco07ex,,0,1631519079.0,"I don't believe in this whole un-rush thing. What show could have done is:

1. **Remove inconsistencies.** For example, in S7 Dany says Viserys was a fool to believe people will call unto him. But then in S8 she got astonished that people didn't love her. What is audience to get out of it? That Dany was an unreliable narrator? This is not the books where we know character's thought process. Another example, Tyrion supports the idea of sieging the city but then doesn't understand that people die in war? Again, what is audience to get out of this? Further, Randyll is supporting Cersei despite her killing his vassal house? What?! Is the show telling me that his xenophobia trumped kin-slaying too?
2. **Dialogues, dialogues and dialogues**! Just compare the dialogues from earlier seasons and see the stark difference.
3. **Don't make characters dumb just for the sake of it:** Why did LF sell Sansa to the guy he knew nothing about? Varys just plotting in Dany's own home instead of working at a distance? What? Tyrion not understanding that war kills people? Claiming that Dany shouldn't send dragons? Was he dumb to think that she'd unleash her dragons or just clairvoyant? Jon Snow couldn't bother lying to Cersei?? The battle strategies in The Long Night?! Were we watching dumb characters all this time? 
4. **Don't stop writing character arcs and world building just because story is coming to a conclusion:** Otherwise it feels very bland.
5. **More consequences please:** Cersei burns down sept, kills House Tyrell but somehow reach lords are fine with it?

People claiming that character arcs of Jaime and Dany were ruined don't understand nuances. They only seem to understand very surface level criticisms. That should change, it's been 2+ years. Writers aren't beholden to follow arcs you want them to.

However, his honor ALSO caused him to not tell Robert on his deathbed, thus allowing a comrade-in-arms to die without that on his shoulders. He also gave Cersei time to ""flee King's Landing"", and did not take up Renly on his offer due to the ""proper line of succession"" stating that Stannis should be king.

There is Zero chance this would have happened to Tywin. He May have bribed littlefinger..but then hed have marched into that room in full armor and with twice the men littlefinger had. Ned should have walked into that room with 100 northmen behind him or not at all.

He couldn't. Because honor. Then a few more times he could have played ball and gotten out. But honor.

That's why Starks die. Unbending honor. It's a big reason why I do not like the change to Robb's marriage from the books.

Arya, never really had to deal with politics to begin with, at least not in the sense of statecraft. 

Robb was absolutely far to neive and trusring. 

And likewise Jon, stuck too much to his honor much like his father to exercise statecraft effectively. Though because Jon never got to be ruler for very long and be part of court culture it's kind of hard to see how he would have adjusted.",2021-09-13 10:01:34

In a traditional fantasy story, there would be no schism between Jon and Dany and they would have saved the world without the death of any innocent life.  Jaime would have stayed with Brienne.

the literal introduction to his character is him throwing the innocents (Bran a literal child -- who even Cersei thought could of lived) out of a window. The innocents were an afterthought with Aerys he was going to kill Jaime's father (which he mentions first btw), Jaime himself, Aerys, The Royal Family, and the innocents. And probabaly the only reason he adds the innocents to the narration because he likes to cry about how 'stupid' they are for making fun of him despite him saving a lot of their lives.",2021-09-13 06:17:26

But putting on Sansa's shoes...damn, why does such a tall lady need to be taller?  Oh, wait...   Her shoes are hard to walk in.  Trying them on, they're stylish shoes of the finest leather, shoes of a queen wannabe who's survived eight years waiting for THE moment.  They nearly got a crown when the wearer held back pre-battle information from her brother and his staff and expected to arrive in the nick of time to save the day, hopefully save their lives, and be acclaimed queen.  But then that booted little bitch Lyanna Mormont opened her at mouth.  Then the shoes' giver, slipper-y Lord Baelish, almost got her to take the throne but that didn't work out either.  Sigh, his free lessons died with him.  

And NOW, this booted Dragon bitch from fiery hell saved the day but won't give up a crown.  Sure, I made a promise to my love-blind bro, based on Family, under the Heart Tree of Truthfulness.  But the hell with that!  I just watched  fiery bitch and her dragons leave--she's beautiful.  But she's so fragile.  So if I tell my loyal Tyrion, he'll tell Old Ball-less and it will get out and...Miss Beautiful will probably go nuts and burn down the capital.  Let 'em burn.  These shoes will still walk a red carpet to a throne.  Jon won't want to be king, and he'll forgive me.  He forgave me before.  And hey, my love-fool Tyrion might even recommend me for the Iron Throne.  Arya will see through it, but she can go jump in the ocean.  And Bran can sit under his Heart Tree and dream until the mountains crumble.  If not, I'll just play the Independence card and rule up here.

Comment,1,hcmgyx0,,0,1631487629.0,"I would do exactly as she did, just not in way she did it. 

Let’s see, Sansa is a girl who just got her family’s home back, after years of being abused by other people who just used her. She’s weary of everyone because although she has the support from the northerners, she still fears people want to take Winterfell from the Starks again. Her brother, Robb, and her mother, Catelyn, died fighting for the North’s independence causing the beginning of the fall of House Stark. She believes her half brother Jon is the key to fulfilling Robb’s dreams to turn the North in an independent kingdom, a cause that, again, he died for. Jon goes to Daenerys as King in the North and comes back calling her Queen of the Seven Kingdoms… 

Sansa doesn’t know Danny, as far as she is concerned she is a foreigner who didn’t even grow up in Westeros and now comes to take back her mad father’s throne, the man who killed her grandfather and her uncle. Of course you shouldn’t judge someone based on their family’s mistakes or evilness, but there is literally a common saying in Westeros that says Targaryens have a tendency for madness (“everytime a Targaryen is born the Gods flip a coin”) and let’s not forget that Sansa’s personality is extremely influenced by Cersei who treated everyone as an enemy. So, Daenerys arrives at Winterfell with three dragons and somehow she managed to convince Jon to give up on his “King in the North” claim… of course Sansa doesn’t like this, she wanted the North’s independence and in her mind Danny was the responsible for Jon giving up on the North’s independence. When Sansa asked Danny what did the dragon’s eat she answered “they eat whatever they want”… like, girl the dragons are yours, their your responsibility and you went through a certain previous situation where you got to know how dangerous they were to people who are not you. Danny’s answer should’ve been less “agressive” and more reassuring that she would take care of it and make sure the dragons didn’t hurt anyone, that’s how a leader should answer (of course I know all of this and the shitty dialogue was due to the bad writing but unfortunately it’s what we have so I have to base my opinion on it). 

So, you have a “queen” that convinced your brother to give up on the North’s independence, a “queen” who apparently didn’t give a shit about her dragons eating people or not, a “queen” who you’ve heard takes no prisoners and burns alive whoever doesn’t bend the knee to her… besides thinking Daenerys wouldn’t be a good queen, Sansa knew she was the only one standing in the middle of the North’s independence, with Danny out of the picture she could finally get what she wanted and avenge her family’s deaths. With this said, yes, I would do exactly as Sansa did, but I guess I wouldn’t be as sneaky as she was (although that was something she learned from Littlefinger, another character who strongly influenced her). 

Ps: I know it sounds a lot like I hate Danny but I promise I don’t xD I’m just imagining myself in Sansa’s position.",2021-09-13 04:30:29
Comment,2,hcmgxly,,0,1631487614.0,"My answer would be based on how Sansa sees it. The only issue is whether I would want the North independent enough.

I say no.

So based on that:

Sansa doesn’t know Dany beyond stories about her and how her brother feels about her.

Based on that, I would side with my fake brother Jon who sided with Dany.

Maybe I try another conversation with Dany that doesnt get interrupted and properly explain our history and position. Maybe I talk to Bran about her so when I do talk to her I have a better understanding of her. Maybe I push for Jon to marry her so I can better advocate that position with my brother as king or at least get more autonomy as a member of the 7 kingdoms. Maybe I ask my omniscient brother Bran if Dragons can be poisoned thus taking away Danys greatest weapon if talks get violent. There are a number of smarter strategies to play with less risk to my people. Sansa strategy was basically reading the script.

Comment,1,hcmcm6t,,0,1631485773.0,"Dany's destiny was always going to be the same, for a simple reason. One of the main teachings of GoT is that power corrupts, and who's got more power than Daenerys? 

As much as I love her, Dany solved most if not all of the problems with one abilty: Raw Power. Not inteligence, not cunning, not strategy. Her military strategies were mostly made by the ""council"" that surrounded her. The only real exception I can think is the Dorathki leaders, but burning all of them alive is still more a power move than anything else. 

Point is, Dani has always been rudeless, and the bigger her dragons grew, the bigger her own ego did. You can see it in how she presents herself:

""Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, The Unburnt, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Queen of Meereen, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Protector of the Realm, Lady Regent of the Seven Kingdoms, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons""

Even if she claimed she was different from the other lords, just like them she had grown to love being powerful.

 It is true, Daenerys was way more merciful to the common folk than any of the others, but at that her breaking point, she did what she had always done before: Destroy her enemies, with dragon fire. 

And people ask ""but she used to be so kind, and comppasionate"" Yeah, that was before she lost two of her sons , one of them thanks to cercei, and her best friend..... She was broken.

I honestly think that Daenerys going crazy is one of the things that will happen in the books. Obivously, with a slower burn that would make it more logical, but it will happens. Specially considering that in the books she has not only one, but TWO nephews that can contest her right to the throne: Jon and the real Aegon Taygaryen, the one born to Elia Martell.",2021-09-13 03:59:33

like not only does Dany clearly value Northern life as beneath her own goals, but she also wants to bring them _back_ under the iron throne, even after the North has been fighting to gain independence after all these years.

She saw a vision in Season 2 of the destroyed Red Keep. She had to be the one that did it. In Season 2 she also let slip how she had darker fantasies of destroying cities. That had to be paid off. 

In her very first scene we are warned that you don’t want to wake the dragon as she enters into a scalding hot bath indicating that she was the real dragon you did not want to wake. 

All that hate and frustration she carried with her from a lifetime of abuse at the hand of her brother and revenge fantasies he spoon fed her had to come busting out in a moment of pure rage to adequately do justice to all the set up.

Comment,2,hclqlju,,0,1631476695.0,">And then within one episode he just abandoned all that with the stupid fucking comment about not caring about the innocents which completely threw his character out the window. The thing about Jaime from the very beginning of the show was that he cared about the innocents. That's why he killed the mad king.

This is just a theory based on assumptions, because nothing (apart from interpreting the bath scene in a specific way) actually reinforces your head canon.

For 7+ seasons we see that he gives zero fucks about the innocents... he's practically the anti-Dany in that sense, so it is insane that some people place him on some same level as Dany considering how very different they come off within the confines on the show. Jaime, for 7+ seasons, does whatever immoral bidding his father/sister order to help their family gain power to the detriment of the innocent, while very clearly stating multiple times that all he cares about is himself and Cersei, and that the rest of the world can ""burn for all I care.""

Yes, a generation ago he did something that, as an effect, saved people, but that's not the same as claiming ""that's why"" he killed the Mad King... you're taking the effect and claiming it is the cause... that's not a logical argument considering what we know about Jaime.

The reason he states he never cared about the people is because he never cared about the people... that's the character he's been for the entire run of the show. He cares about honor, he cares about Cersei, he cares about being a better person in Brienne's eyes, but he doesn't care about ""the people""... and never has, as clearly shown in the entire run of this show.

I can understand why people dislike him returning to Cersei (that's the idea!) but him stating he never cared about the people is absolutely a part of his character that's been portrayed on-screen for practically the entirety of this show.",2021-09-13 01:28:15

Comment,1,hclmepj,,0,1631475071.0,"Well, I’ve been on this subreddit for three days, so I haven’t seen explanation after explanation. I complained here because literally the only thing this post was asking was what was wrong with season 8. It sounds like you’re confident that you are objectively correct and people with differing views of the show are just misinformed or stubborn, so there’s probably no particular point to this.

And yet I’m here, so why not. It’s two things about Jaime for me. Big picture, I mostly agree with you. He kept telling himself and everyone else he was doing what he was doing for Cersei, and in the end, that was the case. But at the same time, he grew. He gained a much greater understanding of the world, he learned how to have personal relationships and care about people, and in losing his hand he had an identity crisis and had to reestablish his sense of self worth. His act of defiance in going North to fight was impressive and felt in-keeping with how things had been going.

And then he just returns. He chooses to be with Cersei and die with Cersei. If you don’t want to call that his arc being undone, it feels like semantics, because it sounds like we’re both seeing that in the end, he winds up exactly where he started. None of his experiences ended up changing his mind. It’s just lame, to me. If you’re satisfied with that, more power to you, but I’m not. 

The other thing is just him sleeping with Brienne. That felt wildly out of character for any version of Jaime and especially the one who, up to that point, cared a great deal about Brienne. In the larger context of the show, it felt to me like the showrunners teasing that he and Brienne might actually be together (which is weird because they were pretty clearly never going to be together), and then having him run away just to dash our hopes and see, “oh darn Jaime actually is still a villain.” It seemed sloppily manipulative and fell flat. That was a good chunk of the “ruin” for me.

It could’ve been fun to see him kill Cersei, though I never expected that to really happen. It seemed likely he’d die, and there were other characters set up to be more heroic so I wasn’t expecting some grand exit for him. I just would’ve really preferred that he’d died without consciously shaking off his experiences of the past seven seasons.",2021-09-13 01:01:11

Comment,28,hcllvep,,0,1631474863.0,I think Yara would just recede after a while. I'm more worried about Bronn. I wonder what the other lords in the reach think about a random ass cutthroat taking over high garden. I'm curious how Tyrion or Bran had the power to make such a drastic decision. Also how does Gendry go about proving his claim as Robert's son? I mean we all know he's his son but how does he prove that? And what happens to the other westerlords now? I feel they would most likely rebel rather than accept Tyrion's rule. And is the Citadel ok with Sam impersonating a maester and electing himself as grand maester?,2021-09-13 00:57:43

Comment,1,hcl6a9y,,0,1631468856.0,"The reason why the first few seasons were done so well was because they had the books to draw inspiration, plotlines, dialogue from, they didn't have that for the last few seasons. 

I think I remember hearing that GRRM had basically given them the end points for each character, and pretty much left them to devise how each character gets to those points. 

There are characters still alive in the books, that were killed off in the show. There are characters that were never introduced into the show, that are important to the books outcome. There are plotlines that were disregarded in the show, that has impact on how the story evolves. The book may end in a similar way, but what happens along the way can drastically change how we feel about the conclusion.

My name is Rob. I've seen every single episode of Game of Thrones at least half a dozen times. I host, edit, and publish every episode. 

My co-host is Lizzy. Before we started our show, she had never seen any episodes before and her only knowledge of Game of Thrones was that ""Peter Dinklage is in it"". 

We're currently midway through season 5, which means Lizzy's reactions to all the classic moments in seasons 1-4 are available to listen to right away. 

We also have interviews with Miltos Yerolemou (Syrio Forel) and featured extras Eric Nolan and Curtis Napier, as well as with Sam Adolfo, who voiced some magical creatures on the show. 

You don't have to ""like and subscribe"" or anything like that, but if you like what you hear and want to stick around for the ride then that would be really lovely. ❤️

That is a red herring counter argument. Six episodes was rushed. There was no way they were going to tie up all the story lines and give them the space they needed to play out. 

They might have been able to do it in 10-12. They still might have failed. But that is not an actual counter argument to the fact that they needed at least 10.",2021-09-12 20:00:47
Comment,2,hcke2qu,,0,1631456856.0,"Sorry to say, but I'm on the complete opposite end, yes it'a rushed but I also hate the choices that the story made to get the characters to be where they were to tie up the story. To me everything had that ""expectation subversion"" cliché that's been so popular in media recently (More on that later).

I'll always hate his decision to just up and return to Cersei, Jaime getting with Brienne was stupid as the show made it seem like that was the only thing he was trying to redeem about himself. The show depicted Jaime trying to regain his own honor that's why he fought so hard to save Myrcella, why he went north to fight with the Starks. And then within one episode he just abandoned all that with the stupid fucking comment about not caring about the innocents which completely threw his character out the window. The thing about Jaime from the very beginning of the show was that he cared about the innocents. That's why he killed the mad king. Most people make a strawmen about his only reason for leaving Cersei was Brienne which is hella stupid as he is a much for developed and complex character. Not some stupid teenager who regret having sex so he went back to his ex as the show depicts.

Bran is the ultimate combination of that YA cliché expectation subversion. It throws away everything about worldbuilding, ""power is where people believe it resides"" and so the peasants are now going to follow a heretical, Northern crippled boy who can't have children? There'd be riots within weeks! Even if he dies of old age there'd be a war of succession and the whole cycle of conquest goes on. Also his ""why else do you think I'm here"" shows how terrible of a person he is, he KNEW the events would unfold out that way (as unrealistic as all the events are) and helped no one just so he could become king, Hodor didn't die for a benevolent cause, he died because the selfish cripple boy who hated life every since being crippled can get revenge to manipulate his way to become king. Also the fact that a Stark ending up as King at all is very much a Young Adult cliché (Oh Look my favorite house now rules all of Westeros!)

Daenerys is very complicated especially in the which of how she did it. Whereas all the terrible things she had done before were to her enemies, those she perceived as such (also Mirri Daz wasn't fully innocent, but she killed Drogo out of Vengeance so it's muddy ground I won't fight on) the fact that she did it all AFTER they all surrendered and there were no more Ballistas is what's stupid where she just stupidly wanted to keep burning innocents, which is such a stupid way to turn her into the full antagonist.

The stupid thing about the Night King is that for some reason the writers didn't incorporate the white walkers into the war for the throne. The north deals with the invasion almost completely on their own with the help from Daenerys. They don't broker any alliances to help, they don't trade for food and resources with any of the other Kingdoms they just fight and win. Which was stupid as hell. They have NO lasting effect in the story after they are gone and the fact that the North lost so many soldiers doesn't change the battle for King's Landing at all. None of the questions about the Others are answered either, they are all just thrown out of the window. Not to mention Azor Ahai got completely trashed. And the fact that the whole war is won because of some slight of hand is the biggest BS in the season.

Rather than tying in all these overlaying plots, the writers made half assed conclusions to each one and smashed them together. Also, wasn't 'revenge has consequences' been a big thing in the show? Why is it okay when Arya does it? Because she's a super assassin? (Also her sex scene with Gendry was mega Young Adult fanservice)

The story had a potential for an excellent ending, even at the end of Season 7 and the ball was dropped hard. There's a reason so many people wrote re-writes and fix its, because there are so many better ways for the story to have gone then it actually did.",2021-09-12 19:57:36

The ending was definitely rushed, they should have taken the extra episodes they were offered to flesh it out better, but I feel that (almost) everything ended as it was always going to. I wasn’t surprised at Dany’s turn, the signs were there from the moment she had her brother get his crown… No one could kill the Night King, so Arya became no one and fulfilled that prophecy. I did hate Jamie’s ending. It fit, but I hated it. Everyone else ended up more or less where they were always headed. 

The biggest problem was that it was rushed. D&D chose to rush it even though they were offered more screen time to properly flesh things out, but also by that point they only had the major plot points GRRM gave them, unlike the fully fleshed out stories they had to draw on in early seasons. Journeys that took whole seasons previously, took a single episode… that’s just lazy writing.

He was also brought up in a world where arranged marriages are the standard. It's not like he didn't know he was expected to have a political marriage, that was always his path. 

The fact that he thought an apology would be enough is what makes him seem so dumb, as was bringing his pregnant wife to the meeting with the man he just betrayed.

The show mainly takes place on the continent of Westeros which is ruled by the Seven Kingdoms. Each of the 7 Kingdoms used to be independent but they were forged into one nation by House Targaryen (house means noble family). The southernmost region of Dorne was never conquered but married into House Targaryen over a hundred years later so keep their royal stylings (The Prince of Dorne) and some of their own laws (firstborn children inherit instead of firstborn sons).  

Westeros mostly follows The Faith of the Seven - a belief in one god with 7 aspects. This was brought from an eastern tribe The Andals who migrated to Westeros. The North worships the Old Gods (trees) since they were never conquered by the Andals and the Old Gods are the religion of the First Men. The Iron Islands worship the Drowned God who is at war with the Storm God. East of Westeros R'Hllor is the dominant religion - the belief in a red god of fire to oppose darkness and night.

The current king is Robert Baratheon who ~16 years before the story starts overthrew House Targaryen",2021-09-12 15:13:50

Of all the things to moan about with Talisa, I don't think basic human decency should be the target.

Yes, of course they were. They were writing an adaptation, they had already moved away from the source material. To write barely any dialogue for the final season because George hadn't written the books is an absurd option. Especially as they chose to write their own versions of many earlier book events.

Comment,2,hcjishd,,0,1631436542.0,"Personally, i really hate the way the show tried to condense storylines that could have filled 2 full more seasons into 2 shorter seasons.

The Dany turn is extremely weird to me though. They have the perfect setup: Dany hates Cersei with all her heart and doesn't want her to live, even when the city surrenders. Very fair with what has happened. Cersei knows that Dany is a liberator and as a precausion, publicly announces that she is inviting hundreds of normal people, women and children included, into the Red Keep.

So why doesn't Dany go after the Red Keep in her hatred? Killing Cersei is the main goal, not slaughtering Kings Landing. She looks at the Red Keep, launches toward it and then just turns away and burns everyone BUT Cersei. Maybe i am missing something obvious, but imo, Dany should have gone for the Red Keep and burned it in its entirety. You'd still have Dany commiting all the war crimes, you'd still have a large obstacle for Jons morals to come to terms with, and the ""turn"" would make much more sense.

It was set up perfectly, and then goes completely off the rails. Really weird to me.",2021-09-12 14:19:02

Sure he'd have been raised to be prepared for the duty of being lord of Winterfell one day, but given his father was neither old or infirm, he probably figured on having 10-15 more years of life before that.

Wild guess, but might be because Dany has three dragons and threatens genocide against mass innocents every other season... while other characters aren't screaming such and claiming they'll take what's theirs through Fire and Blood.

Which to me the whole season outside of 2 scenes lacks any real weight or care. It's good looking (sometimes) but I had almost no investment anymore and the entertainment I got from it was more so comedic rather than dramatic.

I'm surprised the story continued after the wight walkers tbh. But after them the dothraki who are now leaderless, the riverlands are in chaos, the reach and the westerlands in open rebellion, the Dornish and Iron islanders receding, the north is devastated, Daario's control over Mereen slipping there's plenty of ways to go tbh. But ehhhh idk if season 8 stays the same I can't say I'd be dying for a season 9. And the writers killed or wrote off any characters that didn't contribute to the main plot so you'd have to build up new ones. The story could continue but after season 8 I think it's better it didn't. Forgetting this story and focusing on the dance of dragons or anything else would be much better.",2021-09-12 09:36:43

Comment,6,hcipexi,,0,1631416986.0,"A Song of Ice and Fire (ASoIaF) is a series of 7 books (Only 5 are out so far) which is what the show is based on. So reading this series, you can read the original story and how much they differ from the show for better or for worse.
  
Fire and Blood is a single book set ~300 years before ASoIaF. This book mainly talks about House Targaryen and dragons of the time. This is apparently Volume One and there's plans for a Volume 2. But anyway, HBO is making a new show called ""House of the Dragon"" which will be set around this time period.
  
There is another book called A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms which consists of three short stories set ~90 years before ASoIaF. This book simply tells the adventures of a knight, Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire, Egg.
  
So, you can start reading either in release order which is ASoIaF -> AKotSK -> FaB or in chronological order which is the reverse of the above order.
  
  
Just a heads up, if you're reading ASoIaF, it's been more than 10 years since Book 5 has been released, and there's still no news on Book 6 or 7, so take your time while reading them XD.",2021-09-12 08:53:06

Rewatch the show and count how many times Cersei and/or Jaime reference to dying together. And count how many times Jaime hint at possibly leaving Cersei. I guarantee you that the first one will outnumber the second 20 to 1. Jaime never even considered to stop loving Cersei, but he’s repeated since S1 that they have a special relationship, you don’t chose who you love, they are met to be together, they want to die in each other’s arms, etc.",2021-09-12 07:28:05

Comment,14,hci3gdg,,0,1631406554.0,"Many of the usual complaints. It felt rushed and many characters started acting in ways that felt forced and unnatural. I hated the anticlimax that was the Long Night, and how neatly it just tied off that entire side of the show. I hated how painfully obvious the plot armor was in that episode, where you can see named characters get swarmed by wights and then it just cuts away and they’re fine. I also hated how hard it is to see the vast majority of that battle.

I hated that they undid seven seasons worth of character development for Jaime. He was one of my favorite characters, and it felt like they kinda ruined him. I hate how much they dumbed down the most intelligent characters. I hate that Dany can’t see a fleet sailing in front of her. I felt like every enjoyable moment from the final season still felt contrived and as there to get the plot where they wanted. I didn’t mind Danny’s rampage but I don’t feel like they did the work to get her to that state of mind.

“Bran has the best story” feels almost like a direct insult to fans. He does not. I hate how they handled his apparent omniscience. I hate that the new prince of Dorne doesn’t also seek independence. I hate that Jon’s parentage ultimately means very little to the plot. I hate Euron’s eye-liner. I stopped caring about the Starks, I actually stopped caring about most of the characters. I hate how utterly useless Harry Strickland was.

I love some moments. Parts of the Long Night are impressive, Brienne getting knighted, any acknowledgement of Nymeria. Dany’s rampage is very difficult to watch in the best possible way, and the aftermath of that slaughter is striking. But the negatives so outweighed the positives that it didn’t matter much.

Edit: I see many people trotting out the idea that the only people upset were those that got their hopes up for certain outcomes. This was not a matter of expectations for me. I truly didn’t have a desired outcome for who lives, who dies and who sits on the throne. By the middle of season 7 I’d learned not to expect for characters to act rationally or for everything to make sense and I went into 8 only hoping for a satisfying resolution, whatever form it took. Instead I got Bran the Broken.",2021-09-12 05:59:14

The key question to ask anyone who doesn't like the show is what their idea is of what happened in the finale. A lot of people who don't like the show - and I am fully aware of how this sounds - just don't have a full grasp of what happened. Nearly every single question is answered in the show, and there is a vast supply of online locations that are literal heaps of answers.

The show was almost certainly largely written as it went along - but I have never understood why this is such a bad thing. A lot of cultural products were literally created in this very same way - made up on the spot, so to speak - and we don't hold it against any of them. 

A lot of people also don't like the answer, ""it's magic"", either, and that could be a contributing factor. But the island sometimes did island-things. This is like asking, ""but *why* was the Xenomorph blood in Alien acidic?!""

The attack on KL in S8 also demonstrated exactly how she was able to use her dragon to only attack necessary military targets, and could achieve victory without setting fire to the whole city - and that was when KL had been heavily fortified with scorpions and additional Golden company troops , while her own army was much depleted.

Comment,2,hchpgyn,,0,1631400114.0,"How can you have a 'hero' and 'villain' in a very morally grey world.

Starks could be argued that they are dishonourable traitors to the Crown itself. Which were the Targaryens they deposed a few decades earlier in Robert's Rebellion. Then now they are doing the exact same thing, deposing the incest boy Joffrey. Also ignoring, the one true king and lawful heir to Robert Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon. They don't support his claim at all, despite the close relationship of the Baratheons and Starks.

They break their fealty like two times.

They were close to chopping off Jaime Lannister's head off. Which Tywin saw as his heir and successor naturally. I would say he was ruthless in maintaining the balance of power that his family occupied. If he lost against the North and other claimants, he might lose his head.

I don't think he says this in the books, but he says in the show to Arya.

'You think I'd be in my position if I lost a war'

He obviously alittle fearful of losing the war.",2021-09-12 04:11:54

His mistake was changing Roberts last wish. Robert said ""my son Jeoffrey"". Ned wrote ""my true heir"". 

Alternate version. Ned wrote down what what Robert said. Goes to cerci, tells her he didn't have the heart to tell Robert and will honor his wish. Asks for her help to keep the boy from becoming a cruel king (like he did). 

Cerci isn't blind and knows her children. She would have known Ned's honor would make him keep his promise to his friend and her son would be king with an honorable good man to help him.

No need to trust little finger, no need to support Renly, could still have told cerci he knew.

Comment,1,hchhfjl,,0,1631396757.0,"I've seen a lot of people here trying to justify Tywin, my dudes, Tywin was brutal. He mass murder people before the series even started (like the sac of Kings Landing) and even order the killing of children just so they won't be a 'threat' and it's not like his brutality slowed down. He was one of the main architects of the red wedding and even made plans to have his own son murder. Tywin likely has more blood on his hands than any other character.

Some of the justifications I've seen is something like 'everyone else did that stuff'. NO. There are other villains in the series but the idea that Ned, the Starks, or several other houses are just as bad as Tywin is frankly ridiculous. Stop making this point.

We understand his motives, gaining and keeping power with an obsession with his legacy (family legacy as an extension of that). But, understanding his motives is not a justification for his actions.

At Tywin's funeral, serval characters note how bad he smells. The is a metaphor for what Tywin's legacy really is. If you think Tywin isn't a villain or that there was some good in his actions your missing the point.",2021-09-12 03:15:57

He himself demonstrated to Ned the risk you take walking into a room reliant on men whose 'loyalty' to your side is far from absolute, yet he makes exact same mistake himself thinking the Knights of the Vale were loyal to him. 

There's a reason Tywin was so furious about Tyrion being taken prisoner by Cat: ""If another House can seize one of our own and hold him with impunity, we are no longer a house to be feared"". Littlefinger's demise was inevitable, because his wasn't a House to be feared.

There was no-one else in House Baelish, which meant there was no one to avenge him if someone killed him, which meant there was little to fear from killing him. Cersei could have had him killed in S1, with no fear it would provoke a rebellion. His own guards could just as easily have slit his throat to take his coinpurse, and who would've really cared? In the end it was Sansa who turned on him, and he was instantly exposed as no more powerful than Janos Slynt, being dragged off to the Wall bleating about how upset his 'friends in court' would be.",2021-09-12 03:05:43

Comment,1,hchfken,,0,1631395984.0,"i agree the zombie huny was dumb, but the idea was good, it's just that they shouldn't have made it out alive with the entire army of tge night king attacking them.

For daenerys defeats, some of them made sense (highgarden for example, i mean pretending that the Lannisters basically walked into the castle with no resistance was wrong, but if Olenna lost support in her lands, who attacked her instead, yeah she could lose. it was also logical that they attacked highgarden)

I do fully agree that the defeat on sea, so Yara's and the unsullied's fleets, were stupid

I am glad that littlefinger's plans even exist in s7, there is basically no plotting or scheming in s8, which really contributes to it feeling rushed. (Yeah there was Varys plan to put Jon on the throne, but that ended the same episode it started)

Basically (most of) the main plot points are good in s7, but as you say, very poorly executed, while in s8 the whole plot had 0 logic:

for example, dany becoming mad, could be good but there was practically no build-up to it. at least Euron was an established villain, of whom we already knew he had a fleet, when he attacked yara and the unsullied, it didn't just come out of literally nowhere.

Jumping his station from vassel to liege lord needs to be applauded. There has not been a shift for the greater houses since Aegon (excluding the fall of House Targaryan). The Starks have been the power in the North since the age of heroes. He changed that.

Robb’s goal was to kill as many people as possible in Tywin’s army until they sued for peace and acknowledged northern independence. Robb’s exact words were to “litter the south with Lannister dead.” 

So from a Lannister point of view, first Ned tried to have the Lannisters removed from power by revealing the truth of Cersei’s children and then later Robb set out to kill as many of them and their army as possible. Of course to pro-Stark people, Tywin is the villain but the truth is that all the families caused a lot of bloodshed and death and GOT was never about good versus evil because everyone was capable of either depending on how you look at it.",2021-09-12 01:29:44

Comment,9,hcgpobb,,0,1631385052.0,"This isn’t Lord of the Rings. Barristan is a great warrior but he wouldn’t be able to go 1v5 against the rest of the Kingsguard, and that doesn’t take into account the City Watch which outnumbered the Stark men too. The coup would have still failed.

If the coup had succeeded, Tywin would have no choice but to start a war and there would be a war between Stannis and the Lannisters. The North would probably be compelled to join in the fighting as the perpetrators of the coup, meaning war in the Riverlands would probably still happen.

Shireen wouldn’t be betrothed to Rickon - he’s the third son and moreover, Ned has already shown his support of Stannis and there would be no need to secure an alliance. More likely Shireen would be betrothed to Sweetrobin to secure the Vale.

Stannis’s realm would not be peaceful either. Stannis is a hard ruler and wouldn’t be loved much of the smallfolk. Renly would still want the throne as he did in the series and he would still have the Tyrell army backing him - only this time, Stannis would be pre-occupied with war against the Lannisters.

The point of the story is that war between the houses is kind of inevitable. Multiple factions are working to destabilise the realm for various reasons and any potential cause would start a war between most of the kingdoms. A successful coup is probably as likely to start a war as the failed one was.",2021-09-12 00:00:52
Comment,2,hcgpngy,,0,1631385042.0,"I was thinking along the lines of Renly having broken the traditional line of succession by taking the throne himself by force, as Robert did.

From a purely practical standpoint, all the lords who supported Renly rather than Stannis before his death are unlikely to support Stannis afterwards, not least because his inflexible views on treason and justice would end up with him executing a lot of them.",2021-09-12 00:00:42
